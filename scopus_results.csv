Such processes, produced by marine biogenic activity, are the dominant source of sulfate aerosol over the Southern Ocean. Using an atmosphere-only configuration of the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM1-AMIP), we performed eight 10-year simulations for the recent past (2009–2018) during austral summer. We tested the sensitivity of atmospheric DMS to four oceanic DMS datasets and three DMS transfer velocity parameterizations. One oceanic DMS dataset was developed here from satellite chlorophyll a. We find that the choice of oceanic DMS dataset has a larger influence on atmospheric DMS than the choice of DMS transfer velocity. Simulations with linear transfer velocity parameterizations show a more accurate representation of atmospheric DMS concentration than those using quadratic relationships. This work highlights that the oceanic DMS and DMS transfer velocity parameterizations currently used in climate models are poorly constrained for the Southern Ocean region. Simulations using oceanic DMS derived from satellite chlorophyll a data, and when combined with a recently developed linear transfer velocity parameterization for DMS, show better spatial variability than the UKESM1 configuration. We also demonstrate that capturing large-scale spatial variability can be more important than large-scale interannual variability. We recommend that models use a DMS transfer velocity parameterization that was developed specifically for DMS and improvements to oceanic DMS spatial variability. Such improvements may provide a more accurate process-based representation of oceanic and atmospheric DMS, and therefore sulfate aerosol, in the Southern Ocean region."

Underestimations of low-level cloud fraction and liquid water content are suggested to predominantly contribute to these radiation biases. Most model evaluations for radiation focus on summer and rely on satellite products, which have their own limitations. In this work, we use surface-based observations at Macquarie Island to provide the first long-Term, seasonal evaluation of both downwelling surface shortwave and longwave radiation in the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Atmosphere-only Model version 2 (ACCESS-AM2) over the Southern Ocean. The capacity of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product to simulate radiation is also investigated. We utilize the novel lidar simulator, the Automatic Lidar and Ceilometer Framework (ALCF), and all-sky cloud camera observations of cloud fraction to investigate how radiation biases are influenced by cloud properties. Overall, we find an overestimation of +9.5±33.5gm-2 for downwelling surface shortwave radiation fluxes and an underestimation of-2.3±13.5gm-2 for downwelling surface longwave radiation in ACCESS-AM2 in all-sky conditions, with more pronounced shortwave biases of +25.0±48.0gm-2 occurring in summer. CERES presents an overestimation of +8.0±18.0gm-2 for the shortwave and an underestimation of-12.1±12.2gm-2 for the longwave in all-sky conditions. For the cloud radiative effect (CRE) biases, there is an overestimation of +4.8±28.0gm-2 in ACCESS-AM2 and an underestimation of-7.9±20.9gm-2 in CERES. An overestimation of downwelling surface shortwave radiation is associated with an underestimated cloud fraction and low-level cloud occurrence. We suggest that modeled cloud phase is also having an impact on the radiation biases. Our results show that the ACCESS-AM2 model and CERES product require further development to reduce these radiation biases not just in shortwave and in all-sky conditions, but also in longwave and in clear-sky conditions."

We implement a tracking scheme to identify cyclone centers, before using cyclone composites to match concurrent data in ERA5 and WindSat. We find ERA5 and WindSat show comparable spatial structures for all variables, although their distributions show poorer agreement for CLW and precipitation. Compared to WindSat, ERA5 underestimates TCWV by up to 5% and CLW by up to 40%. ERA5 underestimates precipitation in the warm sector by up to 15%, but overestimates in the cold sector by up to 60%. Similar biases in ERA5 are seen compared to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) data, even though AMSR-E radiances are assimilated into ERA5. Comparing ERA5 and WindSat across the cyclone lifecycle, strong spatial correlation is seen as the cyclone deepens and reaches peak intensity, before slightly declining as the cyclone decays. In the cold sector ERA5 shows an underestimation of CLW, yet overestimates precipitation at all lifecycle stages. However, in the warm sector precipitation is underestimated. This potentially suggests biases within the ERA5 parameterizations of cloud and precipitation causing a disconnect between the two. Despite this, ERA5 shows strong correlation with WindSat and determines cyclone structure well across the cyclone lifecycle, showing its value for use in cyclone compositing analysis."

The evolution of low Southern Ocean clouds (cloud-top heights <ĝĝ1/4ĝ3ĝkm) is strongly modulated by precipitation and/or evaporation, which act as the primary sink of cloud condensate. Constraining precipitation processes in ESMs requires robust observations suitable for process-level evaluations. A year-long subset (April 2016-March 2017) of ground-based profiling instrumentation deployed during the Macquarie Island Cloud and Radiation Experiment (MICRE) field campaign (54.5ĝ ĝS, 158.9ĝ ĝE) combines a 95ĝGHz (W-band) Doppler cloud radar, two lidar ceilometers, and balloon-borne soundings to quantify the occurrence frequency of precipitation from the liquid-phase cloud base. Liquid-based clouds at Macquarie Island precipitate ĝ1/4ĝ70ĝ% of the time, with deeper and colder clouds precipitating more frequently and at a higher intensity compared to thinner and warmer clouds. Supercooled cloud layers precipitate more readily than layers with cloud-top temperatures >ĝ0ĝĝ C, regardless of the geometric thickness of the layer, and also evaporate more frequently. We further demonstrate an approach to employ these observational constraints for evaluation of a 9-year GISS-ModelE3 ESM simulation. Model output is processed through the Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC2) radar and lidar instrument simulator with the same instrument specifications as those deployed during MICRE, therefore accounting for instrument sensitivities and ensuring a coherent comparison. Relative to MICRE observations, the ESM produces a smaller cloud occurrence frequency, smaller precipitation occurrence frequency, and greater sub-cloud evaporation. The lower precipitation occurrence frequency by the ESM relative to MICRE contrasts with numerous studies that suggest a ubiquitous bias by ESMs to precipitate too frequently over the SO when compared with satellite-based observations, likely owing to sensitivity limitations of spaceborne instrumentation and different sampling methodologies for ground- versus space-based observations. Despite these deficiencies, the ESM reproduces the observed tendency for deeper and colder clouds to precipitate more frequently and at a higher intensity. The ESM also reproduces specific cloud regimes, including near-surface clouds that account for ĝ1/4ĝ25ĝ% of liquid-based clouds during MICRE and optically thin, non-precipitating clouds that account for ĝ1/4ĝ27ĝ% of clouds with bases higher than 250ĝm. We suggest that the demonstrated framework, which merges observations with appropriately constrained model output, is a valuable approach to evaluate processes responsible for cloud radiative feedbacks in ESMs."

They are often seen as sites of intense ocean–atmosphere heat exchange and as ice production factories. Given their importance, it is crucial to quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived polynya information. Polynyas in their early evolution phase are generally narrow and occur at scales likely too fine to be detected by widely used passive microwave (PMW) radiometric sensors. We derived 40 m scale polynya information over the western Ross Sea from high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 C-band data and examined discrepancies with larger-scale estimates. We utilized two automated algorithms, supervised (a rule-based approach) and unsupervised (a combination of texture analysis with k-means clustering), to accurately identify the polynya areas. We generated data for validation using Sentinel-1 data at instances where polynyas can be visually delineated. Results from PMW sensors (NSIDC and AMSR2) and SAR-based algorithms (rule-based and texture-based) are compared with manually delineated polynya areas obtained through Sentinel-1. Analysis using PMW sensors revealed that NSIDC overestimates larger polynyas and underestimates smaller polynyas compared to AMSR2. We were more accurately able to identify polynya presence and area using Sentinel-1 SAR observations, especially in clear cases and cases when PMW data miscalculates the polynya’s presence. Of our SAR-based algorithms, the rule-based approach was more accurate than the texture-based approach at identifying clear polynyas when validated against manually delineated regions.

Changes in precipitation climatology are typically based on independent analysis of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here we show that where it rains more often, it also rains harder. When grouping global precipitation reanalysis data and observations from the past 40 years into regions of similar wet-day frequency, regardless of geographical separation, there is a strong correlation with wet-day intensity distributions. These wet-day-frequency regions are also more physically coherent than regions based on geographical location. We find the coherent relationship between wet-day frequency and intensity distributions is partially explained by wet-day-frequency regions having similar vertical velocity and convective available potential energy distributions, once polar regions are excluded. These represent dynamic and thermodynamic processes that indicate how conducive wet-day-frequency regions are to large-scale and convective precipitation. This suggests that the main drivers of precipitation are universal. We also show that extreme-precipitation metrics are dependent on wet-day frequency within our framework.

In parallel to ambient measurements of atmospheric composition and seawater biogeochemical properties, we describe semicontrolled experiments to characterize nascent sea spray properties and nucleation from gas-phase biogenic emissions. The experimental framework for studying the impact of the predicted evolution of ozone concentration in the Southern Hemisphere is also detailed. After describing the experimental strategy, we present the oceanic and meteorological context including provisional results on atmospheric thermodynamics, composition, and flux measurements. In situ measurements and flux studies were carried out on different biological communities by sampling surface seawater from subantarctic, subtropical, and frontal water masses. Air–Sea-Interface Tanks (ASIT) were used to quantify biogenic emissions of trace gases under realistic environmental conditions, with nucleation observed in association with biogenic seawater emissions. Sea spray continuously generated produced sea spray fluxes of 34% of organic matter by mass, of which 4% particles had fluorescent properties, and which size distribution resembled the one found in clean sectors of the Southern Ocean. The goal of Sea2Cloud is to generate realistic parameterizations of emission flux dependences of trace gases and nucleation precursors, sea spray, cloud condensation nuclei, and ice nuclei using seawater biogeochemistry, for implementation in regional atmospheric models."

This study provides a statistical quantification of how human influences have changed the frequencies of extreme temperatures in New Zealand, depending on the synoptic weather types. We use the ensembles under pre-industrial conditions (natural scenarios with no human-induced changes) and present-day conditions (anthropogenic scenarios) from the weather@home regional climate model. The ensemble simulations under these two scenarios are used to identify how human influences have impacted the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures based on their connection to different large-scale circulation patterns derived using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Over New Zealand, an average two to three fold rise in frequencies of extremes occurs irrespective of seasons due to anthropogenic influence with a mean temperature increase close to 1°C. For some synoptic situations, the frequency of extremes are especially enhanced; in particular, for low-pressure centres to the northeast of New Zealand where the frequency of occurrence of daily temperature extremes has increased by a factor of 7 between anthropogenic and natural ensembles for the winter season, though these synoptic patterns rarely occur. For low-pressure centres to the northwest of New Zealand, we observe high temperatures frequently in both anthropogenic and natural ensembles which we expect is probably associated with warm air advection from the Tropics. The frequency of occurrence of high temperatures in these synoptic patterns has also increased by a factor of 2 between the natural and anthropogenic ensembles. For these synoptic states, the extremes are observed in the North Island and along the east coast of the country with the highest temperature along the Canterbury coast and Northland. The change between the natural and anthropogenic ensembles is largest on the west coast along the Southern Alps for all the synoptic circulation types."

Therefore, evaluation and improvement of cloud simulation are essential to ensure the accuracy of climate models. We analyse cloud biases and cloud change with respect to global mean near-surface temperature (GMST) in climate models relative to satellite observations and relate them to equilibrium climate sensitivity, transient climate response and cloud feedback. For this purpose, we develop a supervised deep convolutional artificial neural network for determination of cloud types from low-resolution (2.5×2.5) daily mean top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave radiation fields, corresponding to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) cloud genera recorded by human observers in the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). We train this network on top-of-atmosphere radiation retrieved by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and GTS and apply it to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) model output and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalyses. We compare the cloud types between models and satellite observations. We link biases to climate sensitivity and identify a negative linear relationship between the root mean square error of cloud type occurrence derived from the neural network and model equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), transient climate response (TCR) and cloud feedback. This statistical relationship in the model ensemble favours models with higher ECS, TCR and cloud feedback. However, this relationship could be due to the relatively small size of the ensemble used or decoupling between present-day biases and future projected cloud change. Using the abrupt-4×CO2 CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiments, we show that models simulating decreasing stratiform and increasing cumuliform clouds tend to have higher ECS than models simulating increasing stratiform and decreasing cumuliform clouds, and this could also partially explain the association between the model cloud type occurrence error and model ECS."

We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

Often overlooked in cluster analysis is the variability that occurs within any clusters generated. This is particularly important in the geophysics where clusters are often generated with a focus on interpretability over mathematical optimization. Two metrics, the Davies-Bouldin index and the subsom entropy, are used to identify clusters with large internal variability. These metrics are applied to an example set of clusters from prior research that were generated using cloud top pressure-cloud optical thickness joint histograms from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data set. Applying these metrics to the clusters identifies one cluster in particular as a major outlier. Examining the calculations behind these metrics in more detail provides further information about the internal variability of the clusters. The clusters are also examined over several geographic regions showing mostly consistent behavior. There are, however, some large anomalies such as the behavior of the clear sky cluster or the behavior of several different clusters over the Arctic Ocean. To aide our interpretation of these results, two clusters are chosen for a detailed analysis of their subclusters. The geographic distributions and radiative properties of these subclusters are examined and clearly identify that subclusters have physically distinct behavior. This result illustrates that these metrics are capable of determining when a cluster contains physically distinct subclusters. This demonstrates the potential utility of these metrics if they were applied to other geophysical data sets."

This study quantifies the relationship between the winds and sea ice drift and observes the average and annual anomalies across the region. Sea ice drift velocities are based on high-resolution (150 m) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images from Envisat for winters between 2002 and 2012. Sea ice motion vectors were first correlated with the corresponding Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) surface wind velocities, and the sensitivity of the spatial correlations and residuals were examined. Four drift parameters were selected (mean drift, the correlation between drift and wind, drift to wind scaling factor, and the directional drift constancy) to perform an unsupervised k-means classification to automatically distinguish six zones of distinctive sea ice characteristics solely based on ice drift and wind information. Results indicate a heterogeneous pattern of sea ice movement at a rate ranging from 0.41 to 2.24% of the wind speed in different areas. We also find that the directional constancy of sea ice drift is closely related to the wind fields. Sea ice drift and wind velocities display the highest correlation in free-drift areas (R = 0.70), followed by deformational drift zones (R = 0.54), and more random drift areas (R = 0.28). The classification illustrates the significance of localized wind-driven sea ice drift in this coastal area resulting in zones of convergence, shear, and free drift. The results also indicate that the most persistent patterns of sea ice motion are near the RSP and TNBP areas, both being driven by strong localized winds. Our findings identify that large-scale sea ice motion is predominantly wind-driven over much of the study area while ocean currents play only a minor role."

Similarly, the lifetime performance-adjusted gender pay gap has converged to around one-third the price of an average home. Trends suggest that, no matter how much women improve their research scores and “lean-in” for promotions, the performance-adjusted pay gap has plateaued to an equilibrium. Data from an entire national workforce fail to support the most common explanations for academic gender pay gaps—child-bearing and demographic inertia. But results are consistent with a systemic dynamic in which double-binds and double-whammies create a sticky floor that starts women at lower pay and impedes their advancement over time.

Given the complexity of the problem, the diversity of stakeholders, and the failure of current policies to curb AMR worldwide, integrative approaches are needed to identify effective actions. Underpinned by systems thinking and One Health principles, this qualitative study explored how diverse AMR experts in Aotearoa New Zealand perceive the main drivers and effects of AMR. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with clinical, academic, policy, community, and industry representatives were designed to elicit mental models of the causes and outcomes of AMR across dimensions. Results: Thematic analysis revealed contrasting understandings of AMR causes across four domains: food-producing animals (livestock), healthcare, community, and environment. AMR was often framed as a problem of individual behaviour, despite many implicit references to underlying structural economic influences. The politics of collaboration was a further major underlying theme. The interviews highlighted fundamental connections between AMR and other complex issues, including poverty and environmental pollution. Implications for public health: This study brings together the understandings of AMR of transdisciplinary stakeholders, providing some immediate insights for policy makers and setting the foundation for developing a collaborative system model of AMR as a basis for decision-making."

In order to support health and equity, adaptation responses require collaborative, transdisciplinary learning and consensus-building, across a wide range of local-level stakeholders. We aimed to co-develop a shared understanding of the complex interplay between health, health determinants, flooding, and sea-level rise in a low-income urban area of Aotearoa New Zealand, to inform action. Methods: We used qualitative participatory system dynamics modeling, involving interviews and group workshops with transdisciplinary stakeholders. We developed a shared set of wellbeing outcomes and triangulated participants’ knowledge with published evidence to develop a set of causal loop diagrams (CLDs). These capture the system feedback behavior between flooding and sea-level rise, and local health and wellbeing. Results: Thirty-three participants were involved across the project, identifying 22 wellbeing outcomes. The CLDs covered six intersecting themes: community-led development and participation in decision-making; quality of housing; the housing market; the insurance market; economic effects of flooding and sea-level rise; and access issues arising from flooding. Intervention points were identified, with the potential to inform health equity-focused adaptation policy. The process supported shifts in participants’ mental models towards consensus and effective intervention points, and transdisciplinary relationship-building. Conclusion: Participatory systems modeling approaches may support cross-sector collaborative learning about the complex, dynamic influences on health and wellbeing in the context of local climate change adaptation. These shared, holistic understandings are essential to inform decision-making that promotes positive health and social equity outcomes."

The public health effects are varied and complex, and rural primary care staff will be at the front line of effects and responses. However, little is known about their understanding and experience. Objectives: To determine understanding, experiences and preparedness of rural general practice staff in Aotearoa-NZ about climate change and health equity. Methods: A mixed-methods national cross-sectional survey of rural general practice staff was undertaken that included Likert-style and free-text responses. Quantitative data were analysed with simple descriptive analysis and qualitative data were thematically analysed using a deductive framework based on Te Whare Tapa Whā. Results: A proportion of survey respondents remained unsure about climate science and health links, although many others already reported a range of negative climate change health impacts on their communities, and expected these to worsen. Twenty to thirty percent of respondents lacked confidence in their health service’s capability to provide support following extreme weather. Themes included acknowledgement that the health effects of climate change are highly varied and complex, that the health risks for rural communities combine climate change and wider environmental degradation and that climate change will exacerbate existing health inequities. Conclusions: The study adds to sparse information on climate change effects on health in rural primary care. We suggest that tailored professional education on climate change science and rural health equity is still needed, while urgent resourcing and training for interagency disaster response within rural and remote communities is needed."

Te Ara Mua – Future Streets is a project in Māngere, Aotearoa New Zealand, that aims to make it safer and easier for people to get around their local neighbourhood, especially by walking and cycling. Key components include implementation of a street hierarchy and street design changes to reduce speeds on neighbourhood streets, as well as other components including improved active transport infrastructure. Methods: We used tube counters to measure motor vehicle speed and volume before and after the intervention, at different levels of the street hierarchy: arterial, collector and local streets. A difference-in-differences approach was used to assess changes in the intervention area compared with a matched control area. Results: We found post-intervention mean speed reductions of 8 km/h on local streets, and 5–6 km/h on collector streets, relative to the control area. Mean traffic volumes reduced by 17–24% on local streets, with no change on collectors or arterials. Both post-intervention time points showed similar results, indicating a sustained effect. Conclusions: Overall, this intervention successfully reinforced a street hierarchy, creating local residential streets that are more conducive to road safety and active travel. Implementation of similar interventions in disadvantaged neighbourhoods could help reduce road traffic injury inequities within cities. The findings suggest a promising contribution to safer streets that are more attractive for walking and cycling. Our future research will evaluate broader impacts of this intervention on travel mode shift, injury rates and other health and social outcomes."

We investigated whether the effects of transport interventions differ by ethnicity or socio-economic position. The review included empirical (n = 10) and modelling studies (n = 23) that assessed whether the effects of transport interventions on the amount of travel by different modes, major transport-related risk factors or health status differed by ethnicity or socio-economic position. Distance-based pricing for car travel reduced car use more among disadvantaged than privileged groups, in relative but not absolute terms. Whether location-based charging leads to greater reductions in car use or greater improvements in health-related risk factors for disadvantaged groups depends on the distribution of urban deprivation relative to the location of pricing. In the few studies of infrastructure for active travel, outcomes did not clearly favour either disadvantaged or privileged groups. Increasing the price of private motor vehicle travel could help achieve health equity, as long as impacts on access and disposable income for disadvantaged groups are sufficiently mitigated. If active travel infrastructure is to advance health equity, its location and design must prioritise disadvantaged populations. There is a need for more empirical research of pricing interventions, and more research directly assessing health outcomes."

We find that the gender gaps in age and research performance score narrowed from 2006 to 2018, but the gender gaps in pay and performance-adjusted pay did not. Controlling for research performance score, age, and field, women’s odds of advancement to high ranks converged to around two-thirds of men’s advancement odds. Similarly, the lifetime performance-adjusted gender pay gap has converged to around one-third the price of an average home. Trends suggest that, no matter how much women improve their research scores and “lean-in” for promotions, the performance-adjusted pay gap has plateaued to an equilibrium. Data from an entire national workforce fail to support the most common explanations for academic gender pay gaps—child-bearing and demographic inertia. But results are consistent with a systemic dynamic in which double-binds and double-whammies create a sticky floor that starts women at lower pay and impedes their advancement over time.

Without concerted efforts to change the structures of hiring and promotion, the gender pay gap in universities will not disappear of its own inertia."

They are one of the longest living tree species in the world and possess the status of a chief to the local Māori indigenous people of Aotearoa. Over the past decade, a deadly soil-borne pathogen known as kauri dieback has been slowly killing native kauri forests in the Waitākere Ranges, home to a local tribe, Te Kawarau a Maki. Our case study on kauri dieback illustrates the implications of mobilisation and co-governance, specifically regarding power issues and voice of community stakeholders in collaborative decision-making. It is an example of the tension between conservation, recreation, culture, and tourism, which can create harmful ramifications for the management of pathogens. The success in bringing everyone together to protect natural resources is analysed and described here by means of literature research and qualitative interviews with participants."

These powerful morphodynamic systems are prone to recurrent bar reworking and channel shift. When parts of the riverbed are temporarily abandoned by active channels, they are vulnerable to land use intensification. Associated flood protection measures that often follow intensification constrict the rivers' capacity to adjust to ever-changing flows of water and sediment. Despite the rivers' vulnerability and constriction, New Zealand law defines braided rivers in a way that limits local councils' authority to manage land use within the braidplain. This paper explores the relationship between the law and science of braided rivers, demonstrating how legislative reforms underway in 2023 express the ways in which particular social processes play out in the landscape."

Establishing a public EEW system in New Zealand that can warn the general population comes with several reservations as there are many technological, societal, and cultural challenges to overcome. Even with recent technological advances, a successful EEW system will rely on people to react appropriately to the alerts and follow protective action recommendations, such as Drop, Cover, and Hold. Designing an EEW system requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves multiple stakeholders, including the public. This chapter introduces an overarching design science approach in investigating the feasibility of an EEW solution for New Zealand. It includes a participatory design method used for eight community workshops to understand people’s views on EEW. The workshop participants envisaged an EEW system for New Zealand that considers the intersections between services and technology, communication, and human behavior. They expected a holistic EEW system to incorporate public engagement, transparency, and inclusion. The design-led approach described in this chapter puts people at the center, encouraging a close engagement with communities to inform the development of relevant and trusted technological solutions. The robust engagement processes provide insights relevant to designing an EEW system for New Zealand."

The objective of this paper was to describe the role of dietary practices and physical activity in the interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in Nepal, a developing economy. The study was a qualitative study design involving two districts in Nepal, whereby data was collected via key informant interviews (n = 63) and focus group discussions (n = 12). Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was performed, and a causal loop diagram was built to illustrate the dynamic interactions of the social determinants of NCDs based on the themes. The study also involved sense-making sessions with policy level and local stakeholders. Four key interacting themes emerged from the study describing current dietary and physical activity practices, influence of junk food, role of health system and socio-economic factors as root causes. While the current dietary and physical activity-related practices within communities were unhealthy, the broader determinants such as socio-economic circumstances and gender further fuelled such practices. The health system has potential to play a more effective role in the prevention of the behavioural and social determinants of NCDs."

We leverage extensive long-term metadata to quantify genome-wide diversity of the species over time and present new approaches using probabilistic programming, combined with a phenotype dataset spanning five decades, to disentangle phenotypic variance into environmental and genetic effects while quantifying uncertainty in small populations. We find associations for growth, disease susceptibility, clutch size and egg fertility within genic regions previously shown to influence these traits in other species. Finally, we generate breeding values to predict phenotype and illustrate that active management over the past 45 years has maintained both genome-wide diversity and diversity in breeding values and, hence, evolutionary potential. We provide new pathways for informing future conservation management decisions for kākāpō, including prioritizing individuals for translocation and monitoring individuals with poor growth or high disease risk.

Our findings suggest that New Zealand mynas were founded by individuals from Melbourne, which, in turn, were founded by individuals from Maharashtra. We identified two genetic clusters among New Zealand mynas, divided by New Zealand’s North Island’s axial mountain ranges, confirming previous observations that mountains and thick forests may form barriers to myna dispersal.

Despite the increasing availability of genomic data to measure inbreeding accurately across the genome, inbreeding depression studies for threatened species are still scarce due to the difficulty of measuring fitness in the wild. Here, we investigate inbreeding and inbreeding depression for the extensively monitored Tiritiri Mātangi island population of a threatened Aotearoa New Zealand passerine, the hihi (Notiomystis cincta). First, using a custom 45 k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we explore genomic inbreeding patterns by inferring homozygous segments across the genome. Although all individuals have similar levels of ancient inbreeding, highly inbred individuals are affected by recent inbreeding, which can probably be explained by bottleneck effects such as habitat loss after European arrival and their translocation to the island in the 1990s. Second, we investigate genomic inbreeding effects on fitness, measured as lifetime reproductive success, and its three components, juvenile survival, adult annual survival and annual reproductive success, in 363 hihi. We find that global inbreeding significantly affects juvenile survival but none of the remaining fitness traits. Finally, we employ a genome-wide association approach to test the locus-specific effects of inbreeding on fitness, and identify 13 SNPs significantly associated with lifetime reproductive success. Our findings suggest that inbreeding depression does impact hihi, but at different genomic scales for different traits, and that purging has therefore failed to remove all variants with deleterious effects from this population of conservation concern."

In 2013, a single NZSP breeding population was identified on Te Hauturu-o-Toi (Little Barrier Island) in the Hauraki Gulf off the east coast of Aotearoa New Zealand’s North Island. Expeditions in 2021 to the Far North of New Zealand identified numerous NZSP at-sea over 300 km from Te Hauturu-o-Toi, suggesting that another breeding colony may exist. Blood samples collected from NZSP in the Hauraki Gulf and the Far North were used to generate genomic data. These data were analysed to investigate if individuals from the Far North are genetically differentiated from NZSP from the Hauraki Gulf, and if any individuals from the two locations are close relatives. Analyses revealed that NZSP from the Far North and Hauraki Gulf are not genetically distinct, and possible second-degree relatives were identified between the locations. Genetic diversity estimates indicated low population diversity levels and low effective population size estimates. These results suggest that Te Hauturu-o-Toi may be the only NZSP breeding colony, and the Far North represents a foraging location for NZSP. Sex bias fluctuates through the year but is similar in the two locations, also supporting a lack of population structure and indicating little foraging location bias between the sexes. Further research is needed to confirm whether highly connected or recently established colonies exist. These results highlight the extinction risk for NZSP and the importance of conservation efforts on Te Hauturu-o-Toi."

We assembled the genome of a female hihi (Notiomysits cincta), a threatened passerine bird endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. The assembled genome is 1.06 Gb, and is of high quality and highly contiguous, with a contig N50 of 7.0 Mb, estimated QV of 44 and a BUSCO completeness of 96.8%. A male assembly of comparable quality was generated in parallel. A population linkage map was used to scaffold the autosomal contigs into chromosomes. Female and male sequence coverage and comparative genomics analyses were used to identify Z-, and W-linked contigs. In total, 94.6% of the assembly length was assigned to putative nuclear chromosome scaffolds. Native DNA methylation was highly correlated between sexes, with the W chromosome contigs more highly methylated than autosomal chromosomes and Z contigs. 43 differentially methylated regions were identified, and these may represent interesting candidates for the establishment or maintenance of sex differences. By generating a high-quality reference assembly of the heterogametic sex, we have created a resource that enables characterization of genome-wide diversity and facilitates the investigation of female-specific evolutionary processes. The reference genomes will form the basis for fine-scale assessment of the impacts of low genetic diversity and inbreeding on the adaptive potential of the species and will therefore enable tailored and informed conservation management of this threatened taonga (treasured) species."

From a biodiversity genomics perspective, the characterization of genome-wide SVs provides an exciting opportunity to complement single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, little is known about the impacts of SV discovery and genotyping strategies on the characterization of genome-wide SV diversity within and among populations. Here, we explore a near whole-species resequence data set, and long-read sequence data for a subset of highly represented individuals in the critically endangered kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus). We demonstrate that even when using a highly contiguous reference genome, different discovery and genotyping strategies can significantly impact the type, size and location of SVs characterized genome-wide. Further, we found that the mean number of SVs in each of two kākāpō lineages differed both within and across generations. These combined results suggest that genome-wide characterization of SVs remains challenging at the population-scale. We are optimistic that increased accessibility to long-read sequencing and advancements in bioinformatic approaches including multireference approaches like genome graphs will alleviate at least some of the challenges associated with resolving SV characteristics below the species level. In the meantime, we address caveats, highlight considerations, and provide recommendations for the characterization of genome-wide SVs in biodiversity genomic research."

To better understand the establishment of this invasive species, historical records of the myna’s introduction and subsequent distribution were compiled and analysed. We determine that mynas were introduced into New Zealand repeatedly between the 1860s and 1880s, originating from stock acclimatised in Australia with strong links to Melbourne. Additionally, we track the changing distribution of the myna across New Zealand, allowing us to create a detailed timeline. Our findings are discussed in the context of the motivations behind myna introduction, and public response to their introduction and spread."

Onithochiton neglectus (Rochebrune, 1881) is a morphologically variable chiton endemic to New Zealand, with populations distributed over a broad latitudinal environmental gradient. In this species, the morphological variants cluster into 2 geographically separated shell shape groups, and the phenotypic variation in shell shape has been hypothesized to be adaptive. Here, we assessed this hypothesis by comparing neutral genomic differentiation between populations (FST) with an index of phenotypic differentiation (PST). We used 7,562 putatively neutral single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 15 populations and 3 clades of O. neglectus throughout New Zealand to infer FST. PST was calculated from 18 shell shape traits and gave highly variable estimates across populations, clades, and shape groups. By systematically comparing PST with FST, we identified evidence of local adaptation in a number of the O. neglectus shell shape traits. This supports the hypothesis that shell shape could be an adaptive trait, potentially correlated with the ability to live and raft in kelp holdfasts."

Without properly designing such networks, none of these systems work effectively. Network design problems, as the core of network-based decision making systems, can be used to model the technological design of networks. They are widespread and have many industrial applications. In telecommunication, usually an infrastructure is sought, as a combination of possible links and switches, which can best maintain a given level of data traffic between a number of servers and devices. This paper presents a solution to a problem in which in every period of time, the specification of some of the nodes in network may need to be altered. In the current procedure, all arcs and nodes are fixed and only the node parameters need to change. However, the presented solution strategy, because of its multi-layered characteristic, can be easily extended to the cases where arcs and nodes are also subject to change. The solution procedure has been tested on the cloud-based Internet Café problem. In this problem, different types of video games can use different amount of RAM, CPU, GPU, and video-RAM resources, with demand for each type of game varying dynamically in a specified period, e.g., over a day. Different servers provide these resources to dumb-terminals which act essentially as input–output devices, including display monitors, for games running on the servers. Each server needs to provide the necessary resources for the games currently played on all terminals served. In this way, depending on the demand of each terminal, at each period, the terminal's capability can change dynamically, and it will act as a different virtual machine in different periods. Hence, the requirements of the Internet Café infrastructure change dynamically over time. The solution procedure has been tested on a series of generated large instances, and the results are very promising. For a total of 9 cases tested, the optimal solution is obtained, in a matter of minutes, for 3 cases. For an additional 2 cases, the solution obtained is within less than 2% of the optimal solution. The results are also reported for 3 additional test cases for a problem with over 13,000 users and 4,000 seats, demonstrating the procedure capability in handling extra-large problems."

Objectives: To assess the effects of acute assessment services on patient flow following attendance at a hospital ED. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase and two trials registers on 24 September 2022 to identify studies. No restrictions were imposed on publication year, publication type, or publication language. Selection criteria: Studies eligible for inclusion were randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials with at least two intervention and two control sites. Participants were adults (as defined by study authors) receiving care either in the ED or the acute assessment service, where both were based in the hospital setting. The comparison was hospital-based acute assessment services with usual, ED-only care. The outcomes of this review were mortality at time point closest to 30 days, length of stay in the service (in minutes), and waiting time to see a doctor (in minutes). Data collection and analysis: We followed the standard procedures of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care for this review (https://epoc.cochrane.org/resources). Main results: We identified a total of 5754 records in the search. Following assessment of 3609 de-duplicated records, none were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review.

Many factors have been shown to influence the duration of a procedure, in this research we aim to use medical ontological information to improve the predictions. Methods: This paper presents two methods for incorporating the medical information about a surgical procedure into the prediction of the duration of the procedure. The first method uses the Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms to relate different procedures to each other. The second uses simple text fragments. The relationships between types of procedures are included in a regression model for the procedure duration. These methods are applied to data from New Zealand healthcare facilities and the accuracy of the estimations of the durations is compared. In addition a simulation of scheduling the procedures in an operating room is performed. Results: It is shown that both of the methods provide an improvement in the prediction of procedure durations. When compared to a traditional categorical encoding, the ontological information provides an improvement in the continuous ranked probability scores of the prediction of procedure durations from 18.4 min to 17.1 min, and from 25.3 to 21.3 min for types of procedures that are not performed very often. Conclusions: Different methods for encoding medical ontological information in surgery procedure duration predictions are presented, and show an improvement over traditional models. The improvement in duration prediction is shown to improve the efficiency of scheduling in a simple simulation."

However, simulation uptake in construction is lagging due to several challenges such as the extensive data requirements and modelling efforts in a simulation study. This paper aims at addressing this gap by introducing a framework that integrates the practices of simulation modelling with the Last Planner® System (LPS), which is a well-established production planning and control method. The framework focuses on exploiting the outputs of implementing the LPS to support building a valid simulation model. A case study is conducted to test the applicability of the proposed framework. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that the LPS provides a promising avenue for integration with simulation modelling due to the shared processes and requirements between both methods, which may lead to minimised data requirements and modelling efforts for simulation, thus improving simulation uptake in the construction industry."

To identify so-far unseen or understudied threats and opportunities related to climate change we applied a horizon-scanning process. First, we collated 171 threats and opportunities across our diverse fields of research. We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

We explore how these systems and sectors interact with existing and projected climate change stressors by categorising climate change impacts (Trends and Events) and consequential thresholds (Thresholds), and by grouping systems and sectors by types (Typologies). This approach has identified commonalities and differences between the typologies which are illustrated with examples. Critical constraints and opportunities for adaptation have been identified to guide sector adaptation decision-making and for ongoing adaptation progress and effectiveness monitoring. Constraints are found across all sectors, and opportunities exist to address them through modelling and projections, monitoring frameworks, decision tools and measures, governance coordination and integration of the Māori worldview of the relationship between humans and nature.

In developing a deeper understanding of kaitiakitanga, which is often translated as “guardianship”, “stewardship”, or the “principle and practices of intergenerational sustainability”, when working in partnership with Māori, Western-trained scientists can meaningfully acknowledge Māori values, knowledge, process, and practice in their work. This enhanced consideration of kaitiakitanga requires bringing together intricately linked concepts such as whakapapa, rangatiratanga, mana, mauri, tapu, noa, and manaakitanga. In this paper, we aim to guide Western-trained scientists and other practitioners in understanding kaitiakitanga so that they can meaningfully engage through an enhanced understanding of Māori worldviews, knowledge, process, and practice. We also aim to highlight the synergies and differences between kaitiakitanga and conservation and resource management, whilst providing examples of how kaitiakitanga can be used to enhance conservation for holistic sustainability outcomes.

Individuals use leg autotomy to escape predators and there is no regeneration of the missing leg. Here, we tested whether juvenile experience affects adult morph using leg autotomy scars as a proxy of predator encounters. Juvenile males that lost at least one leg (with either locomotory or sensory function) had a 45 times higher probability of becoming a minor morph at adulthood than intact juvenile males.

Contest outcome is determined by an individual’s resource holding potential (RHP) in comparison to that of their opponent. During contests individuals may assess only their own RHP, or they may mutually assess both their own and their opponent’s RHP to determine the effort they allocate to a contest. Male giraffe weevils (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis) bear an elongated rostrum used as a weapon during intense fights over access to females. We used sequential analysis to target the fine-scale structure of contests and phases of contest escalation to determine the assessment strategy used by rival male giraffe weevils in the wild. We found significant non-random temporal structure in behavioural transitions in all transition matrices, and winner and loser transition matrices were significantly different. Contest de-escalation was extremely rare compared to escalation and winners and losers used very different behaviours during contests overall. This study provides support for the sequential assessment model of mutual assessment by male giraffe weevils during competitive interactions. It also demonstrates the utility of sequential analysis in making sense of the often complex interactions occurring in wild insect populations."

Individual variation in behaviour can be consistent across time (personality) and may also be correlated across contexts (behavioural syndromes). Here, we assessed whether Australian black field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) display consistent inter-individual variation in four different contexts: general activity, exploration in a novel environment, boldness after a predation-risk event, and aggression towards a conspecific (fighting). We then assessed whether these four behaviours are linked, forming a behavioural syndrome. We found weak evidence for consistent individual differences in general activity, latency to touch novel objects (i.e. proxy of boldness), and the outcome of a fight. However, none of the repeatable behaviours were correlated across contexts, indicating that there is no behavioural syndrome linking these three particular behaviours. These results suggest that these behavioural traits might be regulated by different biological processes."

When populations are assumed to be well-mixed, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describes the interaction model. Spatially extending these equations with diffusion terms creates a system of partial differential equations which captures both the spatial distribution and mobility of species. In one spatial dimension, travelling wave solutions can be observed, which correspond to periodic orbits in ODEs that describe the system in a steady-state travelling frame of reference. These new ODEs also contain a heteroclinic structure. For three species in cyclic competition, the topology of the heteroclinic cycle in the well-mixed model is preserved in the steady-state travelling frame of reference. We demonstrate that with four species, the heteroclinic cycle which exists in the well-mixed system becomes a heteroclinic network in the travelling frame of reference, with additional heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria not connected in the original cycle. We find new types of travelling waves which are created in symmetry-breaking bifurcations and destroyed in an orbit flip bifurcation with a cycle between only two species. These new cycles explain the existence of ‘defensive alliances’ observed in previous numerical experiments. We further describe the structure of the heteroclinic network for any number of species, and we conjecture how these results may generalise to systems of any arbitrary number of species in cyclic competition."

It is known that deterministic perturbations (inputs) to a heteroclinic cycle generally lead to periodic solutions. Addition of noise to such a system leads to a non-intuitive result: there is a range of noise levels for which the mean residence time near the equilibria of the heteroclinic cycle increases as the noise level increases to a given threshold. We explain how the interaction between noise and inputs gives rise to this by combining analytical results from constructing a Poincaré map with a simple stochastic system. We support our results with numerical simulations.

Resource management in Aotearoa New Zealand currently lacks the relational approach seen in Māori customary harvests. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the key values that underpin this cultural practice. Semi-structured interviews identified three key themes: harvesting practices, kaitiakitanga (resource management based on a Māori worldview), and whanaungatanga (kinship between people). Harvest practices had a bottom-up governance approach creating diverse harvesting techniques that adapt to local environments. Kaitiakitanga identified mana whenua rights to decision-making power in natural resource management as a requirement for success. Whanaungatanga also identified relationships and collaboration as a vital component. To optimize the best outcomes for the environment, we advocate for a genuine cross-cultural and relational approach and the inclusion of these practices and values in the governance of natural resources in Aotearoa New Zealand."

River confinement can accentuate flood risk by promoting development in vulnerable locations and limiting the flexibility to adapt to changing climate, prospectively accentuating future disasters. To date, uptake of space-to-move management interventions that seek to address such shortcomings is yet to happen in Aotearoa New Zealand. This is despite the fact that such practices directly align with Māori (indigenous) conceptualizations of rivers as indivisible, living entities. Treaty of Waitangi obligations that assert Māori rights alongside colonial rights of a settler society provide an additional driver for uptake of space-to-move initiatives.

At present it is unclear how archaeological sites will be affected by future coastal erosion and inundation. In this paper we combine national-scale archaeological and environmental datasets to provide a first-pass overview of archaeological heritage at risk in Aotearoa. Two key national-scale datasets are utilized: (1) coastal sensitivity index (CSI) developed by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research; and (2) ArchSite, Aotearoa’s archaeological site database. The integrated datasets produce insights into the sensitivity of coastal archaeology to SLR and associated hazards, which are vital to planning for the loss of coastal archaeological sites. More than half (∼55%) of recorded coastal archaeological sites around Aotearoa are midden (n = 4938) and about 25% (n = 2271) are earthworks. In total, ca. 12% (9054) of all known archaeological sites are within 1000 m of soft shore shorelines. Of this total, only about 3% (302) of sites are burials, but the loss of these 302 burial sites would have very high cultural impact. Coastal erosion is a particularly important threat to archaeology as it would permanently remove sites, whereas the risk of site removal by coastal flooding inundation is lower. Our results show that about 22% (1954) of coastal archaeological sites are located on landforms that are sensitive to SLR-driven erosion: 29% (2660) of archaeological sites are located on foredune barrier beaches, 23% (2059) on foredune barrier plains, 14% (1283) on beaches, and 9% (808) on beach ridge barriers. This work draws attention to the scale of coastal archaeology in Aotearoa that needs adequate documentation, preservation, and potentially protection in the face of SLR. Robust coastal erosion and inundation datasets are needed to more deeply understand potential SLR-driven impacts on coastal archaeology and provide a scientific foundation for considering future adaptation options."

We support using mātauranga (Māori knowledge, culture, values, and worldview) alongside science, because incorporating socio-cultural perspectives and initiatives allows sustainability to be addressed in a more holistic way. This collaborative group of Māori and Pākehā researchers brings a range of perspectives and expertise to the challenge of working at the interface of IK and science, and practices of conservation and resource management. In developing a deeper understanding of kaitiakitanga, which is often translated as “guardianship”, “stewardship”, or the “principle and practices of intergenerational sustainability”, when working in partnership with Māori, Western-trained scientists can meaningfully acknowledge Māori values, knowledge, process, and practice in their work. This enhanced consideration of kaitiakitanga requires bringing together intricately linked concepts such as whakapapa, rangatiratanga, mana, mauri, tapu, noa, and manaakitanga. In this paper, we aim to guide Western-trained scientists and other practitioners in understanding kaitiakitanga so that they can meaningfully engage through an enhanced understanding of Māori worldviews, knowledge, process, and practice.

Despite the recent nature of the Anthropocene record in global terms (∼650 years since Māori arrival, 250 years of colonial impacts), human disturbance has profoundly altered evolutionary trajectories of river systems across the region. Here we document catchment-by-catchment variability in anthropogenic signature as geomorphic river stories for five catchments (Waiapu, Hikuwai, Waimatā, Waipaoa, Mōtū). We show how targeted, fit-for-purpose process-based rehabilitation programmes that manage at source and at scale are required to facilitate river recovery in each of these catchments. The largest rivers in the region, Waiapu and Waipaoa, comprise steep, highly dissected terrains that are subject to recurrent hillslope failures, including systemic shallow landslides, occasional deep-seated rotational slumps and earthflows. Localised sediment input from large (>10 ha) gully mass movement complexes overwhelms valley floors. Targeted revegetation programmes are required to reduce extreme sediment inputs from these sources. Although there are fewer gully complexes in the Hikuwai, multiple landslips supply vast volumes of fine-grained sediment that aggrade and are recurrently reworked along channel margins in lowland reaches. Waimatā has no gully complexes and a smaller number of landslips, but large areas are subject to sediment input from earthflows. The terrace-constrained flume-like nature of this system efficiently flushes materials ‘from the mountains to the sea’, recurrently reworking materials along channel banks in a similar manner to the lower Hikuwai. Systematic reforestation in the middle-upper catchment and revegetation of riparian corridors is required to reduce sedimentation rates in these catchments. In contrast, terraces buffer sediment delivery from hillslopes in the upper Mōtū catchment, where a bedrock gorge separates large sediment stores along upper reaches from the lower catchment. As reworking of valley floor sediments in response to bed incision and reworking (expansion) of channel margins is the primary contemporary sediment source in this system, bed control structures and revegetation of riparian corridors are required as part of targeted sediment management plans. We contend that geomorphic river stories provide a coherent platform for Anthropocene rehabilitation strategies that work with the character, behaviour and evolutionary trajectories of river systems. Although this generic lens can be applied anywhere in the world, we highlight particular meanings and implications in Aotearoa New Zealand where such thinking aligns directly with Māori values that respect the mana (authority), mauri (lifeforce) and ora (wellbeing) of each and every river."

The lower sand unit is inferred to have been transported from the marine environment, with corresponding increases in the percentages of benthic marine and brackish–marine diatoms, and geochemical properties indicative of sudden changes in environmental conditions. Radiocarbon dating indicates the deposit formation is less than 402 yrs BP, and pollen indicates it is unlikely to be younger than 1870 CE. Core stratigraphy age models and co-seismic chronologies point to the marine unit most likely being emplaced by tsunami transport associated with rupture of the Wairarapa Fault in 1855 CE. The overlying unit of gravel and silt is inferred to be fluvial deposit and slope-wash from the surrounding hills, loosened by ground-shaking following the earthquake. These findings indicate the 1855 CE earthquake may have been more complex than previously thought and, or, available tsunami modelling does not fully capture the local complexities in bathymetry and topography that can cause hazardous and localized tsunami amplification in embayments like Swamp Bay."

Using a set of pairwise competition experiments on annual plants, we provide direct evidence that subtle differences between models lead to contrasting predictions of both coexistence and competitive exclusion. We also show that the effects of environmental context dependency and parameter uncertainty on predictions of species coexistence are not independent of the model used to describe population dynamics.

To reduce impacts induced by the introduction and spread of exotic species, biosecurity interventions are put into place. These interventions often rely on risk-assessment procedures, whereby biosecurity practitioners (which includes researchers, stakeholders such as national park managers, and all other decision makers who determine when and how to protect biodiversity) attempt to preemptively identify and predict which exotic species could potentially become a threat to natural ecosystems. In theory, extensive field and experimental studies would be required to accurately and precisely determine the risks of biological invasion of a species or group of species. However, due to a lack of resources or knowledge, such critical studies are limited. As a result, biosecurity practitioners rarely have a full picture of the extent to which the exotic species has and will spread at the time of decision making. Hence, they instead opt for preventive measures such as identifying and managing potential target exotic species which are likely to be invasive or dispersal pathways through which exotic species are likely to be introduced and spread. As most of the uncertainties pertaining to biosecurity interventions lie in the resolution of data made available to practitioners at the time of decision making, we first present some of the different types of information which are readily available during the risk-assessment procedure. We then highlight how one could exploit these different resolutions of data during the risk-assessment procedure using network analysis to better understand human-mediated dispersal of exotic species. By doing so, our paper puts forward what network analysis has to offer practitioners in the context of biosecurity interventions."

We combined a field experiment with an agent-based model to assess how landscape structure and local flower patch isolation affect pollinator body-size distribution and plant–pollinator interactions, sampled at different spatial extents. We then evaluated how these changes in pollinator functional (i.e. body-size) diversity influence plant reproduction. We observed higher pollinator functional diversity in less-isolated patches, which promoted plant reproduction via a relationship between functional diversity and interaction complementarity. This complementarity occurred partly because larger pollinators interacted with more plant species. Moreover, we showed that patch configuration at the landscape level can change the direction of these local-scale patch isolation effects on pollinator body-size distribution, functional diversity and plant–pollinator interactions. Importantly, these relationships were robust to sampling spatial extent. Thus, management strategies to promote pollination should account for local resources and landscape structure, because response, effect and interaction traits like body size connect landscape filtering effects with local community responses and outcomes of interaction-based functions."

Such networks are built from matrices which describe the effect of each element on all others. Quantifying the strength of these interactions from empirical data can be difficult, however, because the number of potential interactions increases nonlinearly as more elements are included in the system, and not all interactions may be empirically observable when some elements are rare. We present a novel modelling framework which uses measures of species performance in the presence of varying densities of their potential interaction partners to estimate the strength of pairwise interactions in diverse horizontal systems. Our method allows us to directly estimate pairwise effects when they are statistically identifiable and to approximate pairwise effects when they would otherwise be statistically unidentifiable. The resulting interaction matrices can include positive and negative effects, the effect of a species on itself, and allows for non-symmetrical interactions. We show how to link the parameters inferred by our framework to a population dynamics model to make inferences about the effect of interactions on community dynamics and diversity. The advantages of these features are illustrated with a case study on an annual wildflower community of 22 focal and 52 neighbouring species, and a discussion of potential applications of this framework extending well beyond plant community ecology."

Location: Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Taxon: Marine fishes. Methods: We consolidated 100 years of unpublished records and citizen science sightings of tropical, subtropical and rare fishes to develop a focal species database for NZ. Using hotspot analysis, we identified geographic locations where the occurrence and diversity of focal species is greater than expected. We examine the spatiotemporal variation in hotspots by focal species lifestage, habitat and taxonomic family. Results: Focal species occurrences and diversity in NZ have increased. We present 17 new-to-NZ marine fish species, and a new-to-NZ family. Focal species now account for 6.5% of pelagic fishes and 17.3% of benthic fishes in NZ. The northeast of the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) was a consistent hotspot of focal species occurrences and diversity. Hotspots of mature and pelagic fish occurrences appeared further south than juvenile and benthic species occurrences. Families with tropical affinities (Labridae and Pomacentridae) were restricted to northeastern NZ whereas hotspots of families with temperate affinities (i.e. Cheilodactylidae) extended into the South Island (Te Waipounamu). Main Conclusions: Tropical, subtropical and rare fishes are a major component of the fish biodiversity in temperate NZ, and their occurrences and diversity has increased over the past half-century. Northeastern NZ consistently has the highest occurrence rate and diversity of warmer-water fishes.

Methods: Using parametric biogeographical history models, we estimated the ancestral geographical ranges for 144 species based on time-calibrated phylogenies that included endemic species and their closest sister taxa, linking terminal nodes with geographical distribution classified into 14 biogeographical areas. Results: Ancestral range estimations revealed most species originated in Australia (66%), while only 10% and 7% originated in northern tropical Pacific locations and the East Pacific respectively, with 17% of species-range estimations being inconclusive. Vicariant events alone were identified as the most likely process shaping range evolution in 57% of the 14 best-fitting models, dispersal alone was favoured for 14% of species and both processes had a role for the remaining 29% of species. Across all phylogenies, likelihood-ratio tests confirmed that geographical distance and climatic differences constrained dispersal in 73% and 33% of species, respectively. Main Conclusions: Marine fishes endemic to subtropical islands of the Southwest Pacific originated by vicariant and jump-dispersal events mainly from ancestral populations in mainland Australia.

Modification of seeding density is a potential method to manage loss of spat (~ 1–20-mm shell length), by reducing biofouling and intraspecific competition. Understanding the stress responses of spat in production systems during the early stages of aquaculture is a high priority for mussel farmers who aim to manage and optimise mussel production. Here, the effects of seeding density (low: 257, mid: 515, and high: 1030 mussels 10 cm−1 of culture rope), space (depth, site), and time (December 2019 and February 2020) on oxidative stress responses (total antioxidant capacity [TAC] and lipid peroxidation [LP] biomarkers) in spat and their viability (freshwater immersion test) were assessed in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. The effect of seeding density on TAC was variable among depths, sites, and times, whereas seeding density had no impact on LP. In late summer (February 2020), oxidative stress appeared to be higher compared to early summer (December 2019). This indicates that mussels were exposed to more stressful conditions later in summer, although this did not reduce their short-term viability. This research found that seeding density had no major impact on oxidative stress biomarkers and suggests that stress responses and viability of Greenshell™ mussel spat during the summer months are not affected by the seeding density levels measured in this study."

Coral reefs are among the ecosystems most threatened by global change. For wild populations to persist, they must adapt. Knowledge shortfalls about corals' complex ecological and evolutionary dynamics, however, stymie predictions about potential adaptation to future conditions. Here, we review adaptation through the lens of quantitative genetics. We argue that coral adaptation studies can benefit greatly from “wild” quantitative genetic methods, where traits are studied in wild populations undergoing natural selection, genomic relationship matrices can replace breeding experiments, and analyses can be extended to examine genetic constraints among traits. In addition, individuals with advantageous genotypes for anticipated future conditions can be identified. Finally, genomic genotyping supports simultaneous consideration of how genetic diversity is arrayed across geographic and environmental distances, providing greater context for predictions of phenotypic evolution at a metapopulation scale."

But they are increasingly threatened with some areas reporting over 90% declines in kelp forest cover in living memory. Despite their importance and the threats they face, kelp forests are entirely absent from the international conservation dialogue. No international laws, policies, or targets focus on kelp forests and very few countries consider them in their national policy. The Kelp Forest Challenge addresses that gap. Together with 252 kelp experts, professionals, and citizens from 25 countries, the Kelp Forest Challenge was developed as a grassroots vision of what the world can achieve for kelp forest conservation. It is a global call to restore 1 million and protect 3 million hectares of kelp forests by 2040. This is a monumental challenge, that will require coordination across multiple levels of society and the mobilization of immense resources. Pledges may therefore include area for protection or restoration, enabling pledges which assist in conservation (funding, equipment, professional expertise, capacity building), or awareness-based pledges which increase awareness or education about kelp forests. Correspondingly, participants may be from government, scientific institutions, private sector, NGOs, community groups, or individuals. This challenge is the beginning of a 17-year mission to save our kelp forests and anyone and any organisation is invited to participate."

Important species that comprise these ecosystems include canopy forming large brown algae (fucoids and kelp), and understorey species. Here we review current knowledge of the measured impacts of climate change stressors on New Zealand seaweeds. Ocean warming has driven increasing frequencies, durations, and intensities of marine heatwaves globally and in New Zealand. Significant negative impacts resulting from heatwaves have already been observed on New Zealand’s canopy forming brown algae (giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and bull kelp Durvillaea spp.). We predict that ongoing ocean warming and associated marine heatwaves will alter the distributional range and basic physiology of many seaweed species, with poleward range shifts for many species. Increased extreme weather events causes accelerated erosion of sediments into the marine environment and re-suspension of these sediments, termed coastal darkening, which has reduced the growth rates and available vertical space on rocky reefs in New Zealand and is predicted to worsen in the future. Furthermore, ocean acidification will reduce the growth and recruitment of coralline algae, this may reduce the settlement success of many marine invertebrate larvae. Mechanistic underpinnings of the effects of multiple drivers occurring in combination is poorly described. Finally, local stressors, such as overfishing, will likely interact with global change in these ecosystems. Thus, we predict very different futures for New Zealand seaweed ecosystems depending on whether they are managed appropriately or not. Given recent increases in sea surface temperatures and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in some regions of New Zealand, predicting the impacts of climate change on seaweeds and the important communities they support is becoming increasingly important for conserving resilient seaweed ecosystems in the future."

However, large-scale tree planting in Aotearoa New Zealand has been dominated by exotic species. Although there is growing public and expert support for using native species for forest revegetation in farm landscapes, there are two key barriers. First, the lack of ecological and economic data on native species performance in different environmental conditions. Second, policy and market-related mechanisms associated with carbon sequestration, such as the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, favor the continuing use of exotic tree species, especially Pinus radiata, over native species. Consequently, there are strong incentives for exotic forests and insufficient financial support for natives, even when native forest re-establishment is often the preference of landowners, Indigenous peoples, and local communities. The AUT Living Laboratories Program is a long-term, transdisciplinary, experimental restoration research program aimed at addressing scientific, social, and economic knowledge gaps for native revegetation as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) on farmland soils. Here, we present the project design and establishment information from the three experimental restoration sites, which vary in native species composition, planting configuration, and environmental and socio-cultural context. Each site involves partnerships with Indigenous communities, specifically Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, Ngāti Manuhiri, and Ngāti Pāoa, to value and embed mātauranga Māori as Indigenous knowledge. Monitoring carbon sequestration along with changes in ecological functions and outcomes, including native biodiversity, will be critical to ensure that large-scale tree-planting aligns with the government’s strategies for climate change, native biodiversity, and economic prosperity."

The effectiveness of adaptation is constrained by how fast greenhouse gas emissions are reduced globally, the pace of change, the frequency and progression of impacts, and the capacity of our natural, societal and political systems to respond. We explore how these systems and sectors interact with existing and projected climate change stressors by categorising climate change impacts (Trends and Events) and consequential thresholds (Thresholds), and by grouping systems and sectors by types (Typologies). This approach has identified commonalities and differences between the typologies which are illustrated with examples. Critical constraints and opportunities for adaptation have been identified to guide sector adaptation decision-making and for ongoing adaptation progress and effectiveness monitoring. Constraints are found across all sectors, and opportunities exist to address them through modelling and projections, monitoring frameworks, decision tools and measures, governance coordination and integration of the Māori worldview of the relationship between humans and nature. However, limits to adaptation exist and will increase over time unless all sectors and all nations urgently reduce their emissions."

Effects of climate change on agricultural production will be both direct, such as crop losses due to flooding, and indirect, such as increased invasive pest insect and weed pressure on horticultural production or decline in water capture capacity in pastoral South Island High Country tussock grasslands due to increased fire frequency combined with grazing. It is crucial to understand the complex, interactive effects of climate change on agroecosystems, mediated by biodiversity, if human interventions, such as land management, are to be developed and effectively applied to mitigate negative consequences. Even better is if those interventions can be used to address the biodiversity crisis.

This operational research was performed to identify approaches best suited for early case detection, determine community-based leprosy epidemiology, and identify hidden leprosy cases early and respond with prompt treatment. Methods: Active case detection was undertaken in two Nepali provinces with the greatest burden of leprosy, Madhesh Province (40% national cases) and Lumbini Province (18%) and at-risk prison populations in Madhesh, Lumbini and Bagmati provinces. Case detection was performed by (1) house-to-house visits among vulnerable populations (n = 26,469); (2) contact examination and tracing (n = 7608); in Madhesh and Lumbini Provinces and, (3) screening prison populations (n = 4428) in Madhesh, Lumbini and Bagmati Provinces of Nepal. Per case direct medical and non-medical costs for each approach were calculated. Results: New case detection rates were highest for contact tracing (250), followed by house-to-house visits (102) and prison screening (45) per 100,000 population screened. However, the cost per case identified was cheapest for house-to-house visits [Nepalese rupee (NPR) 76,500/case], followed by contact tracing (NPR 90,286/case) and prison screening (NPR 298,300/case). House-to-house and contact tracing case paucibacillary/multibacillary (PB:MB) ratios were 59:41 and 68:32; female/male ratios 63:37 and 57:43; pediatric cases 11% in both approaches; and grade-2 disabilities (G2D) 11% and 5%, respectively. Developing leprosy was not significantly different among household and neighbor contacts [odds ratios (OR) = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24–5.85] and for contacts of MB versus PB cases (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.26–2.0). Attack rates were not significantly different among household contacts of MB cases (0.32%, 95% CI 0.07–0.94%) and PB cases (0.13%, 95% CI 0.03–0.73) (χ 2 = 0.07, df = 1, P = 0.9) and neighbor contacts of MB cases (0.23%, 0.1–0.46) and PB cases (0.48%, 0.19–0.98) (χ 2 = 0.8, df = 1, P = 0.7). BCG vaccination with scar presence had a significant protective effect against leprosy (OR = 0.42, 0.22–0.81). Conclusions: The most effective case identification approach here is contact tracing, followed by house-to-house visits in vulnerable populations and screening in prisons, although house-to-house visits are cheaper. The findings suggest that hidden cases, recent transmission, and late diagnosis in the community exist and highlight the importance of early case detection."

Effective antibiotic treatment is an essential component of universal healthcare, and it is a global responsibility to ensure appropriate use. Currently, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to develop new antibiotics due to scientific, regulatory, and financial barriers, further emphasizing the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. To address this issue, the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery established an international multidisciplinary task force of 295 experts from 115 countries with different backgrounds. The task force developed a position statement called WARNING (Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance National/International Network Group) aimed at raising awareness of antimicrobial resistance and improving antibiotic prescribing practices worldwide. The statement outlined is 10 axioms, or “golden rules,” for the appropriate use of antibiotics that all healthcare workers should consistently adhere in clinical practice."

We consider direct and indirect transmission pathways by modeling four scenarios with livestock and mammalian wildlife as potential and known reservoirs before examining how access to healthcare varies within clusters and scenarios. We found 19 clusters with differing risk factor contributions within a single country (N = 9) or transboundary (N = 10). High-risk areas were mainly closer (11-20%) rather than far (< 1%) from healthcare. Areas far from healthcare reveal healthcare access inequalities, especially Scenario 3, which includes wild mammals and not livestock as secondary hosts. China (N = 2) and Indonesia (N = 1) had clusters with the highest risk. Our findings can help stakeholders in land use planning, integrating healthcare implementation and One Health actions."

One Health is an integrated approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize human, animal and ecosystem health. Conventional disease surveillance has been siloed by sectors, with separate systems addressing the health of humans, domestic animals, cultivated plants, wildlife and the environment. One Health surveillance should include integrated surveillance for known and unknown pathogens, but combined with this more traditional disease-based surveillance, it also must include surveillance of drivers of disease emergence to improve prevention and mitigation of spill-over events.

This action is due to the potential for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) following blood transfusions from preclinical vCJD cases, who themselves mostly developed disease from the consumption of cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) during this period, or from those incubating the misfolded prion proteins that cause disease. This donor exclusion policy led to 10% of New Zealand's active blood donors in 2000 being excluded, and it remains today despite periodic shortages of some blood products. Globally there have been 232 vCJD cases recorded-178 in the UK-with no new cases since 2019 and the peak numbers 23 years ago in 2000. Only three confirmed cases have been linked to blood transfusion. Here, we aimed to estimate the annual risk of vCJD from blood transfusion in New Zealand after restriction removal. We used UK case numbers, population estimates, and donor and recipient transfusion numbers to calculate the risk to the New Zealand public. We calculated the risk, based on approximately 131,000 transfusions a year and accounting for multiple transfusions, might lead to 0.005 cases annually, or approximately one in one billion nationally, and comparable to recent one in 1.45 billion estimates for Australia. Our analyses suggests that relaxing current blood donation restrictions, like Ireland and Australia's recent policy changes, would lead to an extremely low risk of vCJD transfusion-transmission in New Zealand. This policy change would help increase the supply of blood products for multiple medical needs."

For the period 2010-2017, 318 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks were reported in New Zealand resulting in 1634 cases and 20 hospitalizations. The most important mode of transmission was person-to-person (primary infections and secondary or close contacts infections), relating to 260 outbreaks and 1320 cases, followed by 113 outbreaks associated with animals, resulting in 436 human cases. From 2018 to 2021, there were 37 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks associated with 324 cases. We identified the subtypes by using polymerase chain reaction targeting the gp60 gene and the likelihood of mixed subtype infections with the Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition (TIDE) algorithm. Subtype families Ib and Ig of Cryptosporidium hominis and IIa and IId of Cryptosporidium parvum were found among cases; however, C. hominis subtypes occurred in 8 of the 11 outbreaks reviewed where molecular data were available. Examination of the chromatograms showed no mixed subtype infections in the samples assessed. Subtyping data need to be routinely incorporated into national surveillance programmes to better understand the epidemiology, sources, transmission and extent of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in New Zealand.

Cryptosporidium serpentis was identified in two Jewelled geckos using 18S. In New Zealand, C. hominis and C. parvum are associated with infections in humans and introduced domestic animals but have also been recently found in wildlife. Our finding of Cryptosporidium infection in endemic reptiles can help inform strategies to monitor the conservation of species and manage potential introductions of pathogens to in-situ and ex-situ populations."

Background: A range of differential diagnoses have been reported for severe duodenal architectural distortion. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data of all the patients with severe duodenal architectural distortion diagnosed at MidCentral District Health Board (DHB), New Zealand were collected and statistically analysed. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) are shown. Results: Between September 2009 and April 2019, 229 patients were diagnosed with severe enteropathy. The median patient age was 41 years (range 6-83 years). Two hundred and twenty-four of these patients (97.8%, 95.0-99.3%) were diagnosed with coeliac disease (CeD), with one of these patients having gluten induced T-cell lymphoma. From the remaining five patients, one had a diagnosis of tropical sprue and four did not have a clear aetiology. There were 180 patients from 191 (94.2%, 89.9-97.1%) with at least one positive coeliac marker, all with a diagnosis of CeD. Eleven patients (5.8% of 191, 2.9-10.1%) had negative markers for both tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) and IgA-endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA) with six having a diagnosis of seronegative CeD. Conclusion: Although the spectrum of histological changes in CeD may range from normal to a flat mucosa, severe duodenal architectural distortion seems to occur mainly in CeD. Idiopathic enteropathy was recorded as the second but by far less frequent presentation of severe enteropathy. This study highlights that infection and other aetiologies are rarely implicated in severe enteropathy, with one case (0.4%) of refractory CeD/T-cell lymphoma."

The primary symptom is diarrhea, but patients may exhibit different symptoms based on the species of the Cryptosporidium parasite they are infected with. Furthermore, some genotypes within species are more transmissible and apparently virulent than others. The mechanisms underpinning these differences are not understood, and an effective in vitro system for Cryptosporidium culture would help advance our understanding of these differences. Using COLO-680N cells, we employed flow cytometry and microscopy along with the C. parvum-specific antibody Sporo-Glo™ to characterize infected cells 48 h following an infection with C. parvum or C. hominis. The Cryptosporidium parvum-infected cells showed higher levels of signal using Sporo-Glo™ than C. hominis-infected cells, which was likely because Sporo-Glo™ was generated against C. parvum. We found a subset of cells from infected cultures that expressed a novel, dose-dependent auto-fluorescent signal that was detectable across a range of wavelengths. The population of cells that expressed this signal increased proportionately to the multiplicity of infection. The spectral cytometry results confirmed that the signature of this subset of host cells closely matched that of oocysts present in the infectious ecosystem, pointing to a parasitic origin. Present in both C. parvum and C. hominis cultures, we named this Sig M, and due to its distinct profile in cells from both infections, it could be a better marker for assessing Cryptosporidium infection in COLO-680N cells than Sporo-Glo™. We also noted Sig M’s impact on Sporo-Glo™ detection as Sporo-Glo™ uses fluoroscein–isothiocynate, which is detected where Sig M also fluoresces. Lastly, we used NanoString nCounter® analysis to investigate the transcriptomic landscape for the two Cryptosporidium species, assessing the gene expression of 144 host and parasite genes. Despite the host gene expression being at high levels, the levels of putative intracellular Cryptosporidium gene expression were low, with no significant difference from controls, which could be, in part, explained by the abundance of uninfected cells present as determined by both Sporo-Glo™ and Sig M analyses. This study shows for the first time that a natural auto-fluorescent signal, Sig M, linked to Cryptosporidium infection can be detected in infected host cells without any fluorescent labeling strategies and that the COLO-680N cell line and spectral cytometry could be useful tools to advance the understanding of Cryptosporidium infectivity."

This study aims to provide updated evidence on cancer incidence, mortality and survival rates among Pacific Peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand. METHODS: The study extracted incident cases of cancer diagnosed between 2007-2019 from the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR) and linked them to the national Mortality Collection to determine individuals who died of cancer over the study period. The study also compared cancer survival rates between Pacific and European peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand. The most commonly diagnosed cancers and the most common causes of cancer death among Pacific Peoples were identified, and key findings were summarised. The European population was utilised as the comparator group for the analyses. The study employed a total ethnicity approach, wherein anyone with a record of Pacific ethnicity was classified as Total Pacific, regardless of other ethnicities. The age- and sex-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated, and 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates determined. We used Cox proportional-hazards models to compare survival outcomes between Pacific and European peoples. CONCLUSIONS: The study results revealed that Pacific Peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand experience higher cancer incidence and a lower survival rate for several cancers, including lung, liver and stomach cancers, when compared to the European population. This study underscores the need for intervention to reduce the burden of cancer among Pacific Peoples and improve cancer outcomes. This study's findings can inform planning and delivery of interventions to achieve equitable outcomes across the cancer continuum for Pacific Peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand."

Methods: Women diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer between 2005 and 2020 were identified from Te Rēhita Mate Ūtaetae—Breast Cancer Foundation New Zealand National Register, with diabetes status determined using New Zealand’s Virtual Diabetes Register. The cancer treatments examined included breast conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, breast reconstruction after mastectomy, and adjuvant radiotherapy after BCS. Logistic regression modelling was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of having cancer treatment and treatment delay (> 31 days) for patients with diabetes at the time of cancer diagnosis compared to patients without diabetes. Results: We identified 25,557 women diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer in 2005–2020, including 2906 (11.4%) with diabetes. After adjustment for other factors, there was no significant difference overall in risk of women with diabetes having no surgery (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94–1.33), although for patients with stage I disease not having surgery was more likely (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05–2.00) in the diabetes group. Patients with diabetes were more likely to have their surgery delayed (adjusted OR of 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–1.27) and less likely to have reconstruction after mastectomy compared to the non-diabetes group—adjusted OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.35–0.84) for stage I cancer, 0.50 (95% CI 0.34–0.75) for stage II and 0.48 (95% CI 0.24–1.00) for stage III cancer. Conclusions: Diabetes is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving surgery and a greater delay to surgery. Women with diabetes are also less likely to have breast reconstruction after mastectomy. These differences need to be taken in to account when considering factors that may impact on the outcomes of women with diabetes especially for Māori, Pacific and Asian women."

METHODS: In this study, we investigate the co-occurrence of cancer and diabetes by ethnic groups in New Zealand. National-level diabetes and cancer data on nearly five million individuals over 44 million person-years were used to describe the rate of cancer in a national prevalent cohort of peoples with diabetes versus those without diabetes, by ethnic group (Māori, Pacific, South Asian, Other Asian, and European peoples). RESULTS: The rate of cancer was greater for those with diabetes regardless of ethnic group (age-adjusted rate ratios, Māori, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.42; Pacific, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.43; South Asian, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.36; Other Asian, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.43; European, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.31). Māori had the highest rate of diabetes and cancer co-occurrence. Rates of GI, endocrine, and obesity-related cancers comprised a bulk of the excess cancers occurring among Māori and Pacific peoples with diabetes. CONCLUSION: Our observations reinforce the need for the primordial prevention of risk factors that are shared between diabetes and cancer. Also, the commonality of diabetes and cancer co-occurrence, particularly for Māori, reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary, joined-up approach to the detection and care of both conditions. Given the disproportionate burden of diabetes and those cancers that share risk factors with diabetes, action in these areas is likely to reduce ethnic inequities in outcomes from both conditions."

Methods: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2020 were identified from the National Breast Cancer Register. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of having stage III–IV cancer and the OR of having stage IV cancer for women with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. The adjusted OR of having screen-detected breast cancers for patients aged 45–69 years with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes was estimated. Results: 26,968 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, with 3,137 (11.6%) patients having diabetes at the time of cancer diagnosis. The probability of co-occurrence of diabetes and breast cancer increased with time. Māori, Pacific and Asian women were more likely to have diabetes than European/Others. The probability of having diabetes also increased with age. For patients with diabetes, the probability of being diagnosed with stage III–IV cancer and stage IV cancer was higher than for patients without diabetes (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03–1.27; and 1.17, 95% CI 1.00–1.38). Women aged 45–69 years with diabetes were more likely to have screen-detected cancer than those without diabetes (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02–1.26). Conclusions: The co-occurrence of diabetes and breast cancer is becoming more common. Overall there is a small but significant adverse impact of having advanced disease for women with diabetes that is found at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, and this may contribute to other inequities that occur in the treatment pathway that may impact on patient outcomes."

This approach is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. An alternative to this is an assessment based on satellite data, which can provide faster, cheaper, and possibly accurate insights into disaster’s specific impacts. An even timelier option of disaster ‘nowcasting’ is supposed to inform on impacts during or very shortly after the event. Typically, this has been done using risk models, but these usually do not account for compounding and cascading effects. We propose a novel nowcasting approach for tropical cyclones employing pre-existing socio-economic and demographic data and calibrated with satellite data. The method could be used to assess cyclone impacts based only on its known trajectory, and even before post-event satellite imagery is available. We investigate the feasibility of this approach focusing on Fiji and its agricultural sector. We link remote sensing data with available household surveys and the agricultural census data to identify potential correlates of vegetation damage from cyclones. If robust enough, these correlates could later be used for nowcasting cyclone impacts. We show that remote sensing data, when combined with pre-event socio-economic and demographic data, can be used for both nowcasting and post-disaster damage assessments."

It is within such institutions and organisations, built on colonial and patriarchal values, that experiences of marginalisation, oppression and harassment have been documented. We destabilise the apparently static nature of this ‘research system monolith’ by taking up MacLeavy, Fannin and Larner's (2021) provocation of a feminist approach to boldly do leadership differently.

We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

In 2021, Soilsafe Aotearoa surveyed the adult population of New Zealand about how they value soil, particularly values related to how they care about and are concerned about soil. Pursuant to this study, Soilsafe Kids (the outreach branch of Soilsafe Aotearoa) developed a combined research and outreach program to collect a supplemental data set of children’s soil values, so both adults’ and children’s voices can be considered when understanding the implications of different practices and how to care for presently “uncared for” or neglected soils in the future. Objective: The program not only asks primary school students about their soil values but also aims to teach them about soil from many disciplinary perspectives to enhance their understanding and awareness of soil, and, more broadly, for knowledge production. Methods: Here we describe the research protocol used in this Soilsafe Kids program. This program uses surveys (in the form of worksheets), focus groups (introduced as group discussions), and art projects to learn what children think about soil in Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland. We have received ethics approval from the University of Auckland’s Human Participants Ethics Committee (reference number 23556) on March 25, 2022, for 3 years. Results: We have begun recruiting participants and delivering the Soilsafe Kids program in schools across Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland. Our data collection is ongoing with final student engagement in the first quarter of 2023. We expect to analyze data at the start of 2023 and to disseminate results later this year. Conclusions: Once this study is complete, we will disseminate the final results to the research community, stakeholders, and the local community through conference presentations, journal articles, hui (meetings), on our website, and in art exhibits. We note that although Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland is home to the majority of people living in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Auckland region only represents a small portion of Aotearoa New Zealand’s land, and findings are not generalizable to Aotearoa New Zealand as a whole."

Cities built on soil derived from volcanic rock make up a rare yet important subset of urban areas globally. Here we conducted an urban geochemical baseline survey over Auckland, New Zealand's most populous city, built over several volcanic fields and formations. Soils were analysed by aqua regia digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for 65 elements, and C and N isotopes. Multivariate analysis showed volcanic parent material was a dominant natural source of metals in Auckland soils. C4 grasses significantly influenced the isotope signature in urban soils. Metal contamination was associated with urban soils and is linked to anthropogenic sources including leaded paint, tyre wear and industrialisation, and pesticides and spray residues on land that was formerly horticultural. We compare our results against other urban areas built on volcanic rock and with either a similar duration of urbanisation (Dunedin, New Zealand: c. 180 years) or a much longer period (Naples, Italy: c. 3000 years) and one urban area built on a non-volcanic substrate (Arica, Chile: 500 year-occupation). We found Dunedin soils are elevated in Cd, Pb and Zn relative to Auckland, despite an 11-fold smaller population. We attribute these legacy elements to a high proportion of pre-1970, timber clad dwellings in Dunedin with original leaded paint, relative to Auckland. Both Naples and Arica have elevated As, Pb and Zn in soil, and Naples also has higher Cd and Cu, relative to the New Zealand urban studies. We conclude that duration of urbanisation is a dominant factor in soil pollution, but where cities have similar urbanisation periods, then factors such as the age and quality of housing can be dominant. Cities built over volcanic rock like Auckland and Naples have soils elevated in Cr, Ni, large ion lithophiles, high field strength elements and rare earth elements, relative to cities with non-volcanic substrates, such as Arica."

However, they can fail to detect hierarchical patterns of features that exist in many real-world problems, such as understanding speech or recognizing object ontologies. Biological nervous systems have the ability to abstract knowledge from simple and small-scale problems in order to then apply it to resolve more complex problems in similar and related domains. It is thought that lateral asymmetry of biological brains allows modular learning to occur at different levels of abstraction, which can then be transferred between tasks. This work develops a novel evolutionary machine-learning (EML) system that incorporates lateralization and modular learning at different levels of abstraction. The results of analyzable Boolean tasks show that the lateralized system has the ability to encapsulate underlying knowledge patterns in the form of building blocks of knowledge (BBK). Lateralized abstraction transforms complex problems into simple ones by reusing general patterns (e.g., any parity problem becomes a sequence of the 2-bit parity problem). By enabling abstraction in evolutionary computation, the lateralized system is able to identify complex patterns (e.g., in hierarchical multiplexer (HMux) problems) better than existing systems."

More realistic paradigms using virtual reality (VR) may be better suited to investigate authentic emotional states and their neuronal correlates. This pre-registered study examines the neuronal underpinnings of naturalistic fear, measured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Seventy-five healthy participants walked across a virtual plank which extended from the side of a skyscraper - either 80 storeys up (the negative condition) or at street level (the neutral condition). Subjective ratings showed that the negative condition induced feelings of fear. Following the VR experience, participants passively viewed negative and neutral images from the international affective picture system (IAPS) outside of VR. We compared frontal alpha asymmetry between the plank and IAPS task and across valence of the conditions. Asymmetry indices in the plank task revealed greater right-hemispheric lateralization during the negative VR condition, relative to the neutral VR condition and to IAPS viewing. Within the IAPS task, no significant asymmetries were detected. In summary, our findings indicate that immersive technologies such as VR can advance emotion research by providing more ecologically valid ways to induce emotion."

We recruited 100 young women with past-year NSSI and 100 without NSSI to an online experiment. Participants took part in a baseline social inclusion ball-tossing game, followed by either an overt or subtle social exclusion ball-tossing game, while we measured negative mood and belongingness. Despite reporting greater emotion reactivity (d = 1.40) and dysregulation (d = 1.63) than controls, women with past-year NSSI showed no differences in negative mood or belongingness ratings in response to either overt or subtle social exclusion. Within the NSSI group, exploratory analyses found greater endorsement of intrapersonal functions predicted greater negative mood following social exclusion (β = 0.19). Given that amplified emotional responding is central to prominent theoretical models of NSSI, findings highlight the need to better understand the divergence in findings between self-reported emotion dysregulation and real-time emotional responding among people who self-injure."

In Round 0, 106 experts generated 453 statements on what they considered good practice in their field of expertise. Statements were organised into a 295-statement survey that the experts then were asked, in Round 1, to independently assess for importance and support, which further reduced the survey to 241 statements that were presented again to the experts in Round 2.

One way to improve our ability to predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species interactions. Graph embedding is an emerging field in machine learning that holds great potential for ecological problems. Here, we outline how the challenges associated with inferring metawebs line-up with the advantages of graph embeddings; followed by a discussion as to how the choice of the species pool has consequences on the reconstructed network, specifically as to the role of human-made (or arbitrarily assigned) boundaries and how these may influence ecological hypotheses."

To reduce impacts induced by the introduction and spread of exotic species, biosecurity interventions are put into place. These interventions often rely on risk-assessment procedures, whereby biosecurity practitioners (which includes researchers, stakeholders such as national park managers, and all other decision makers who determine when and how to protect biodiversity) attempt to preemptively identify and predict which exotic species could potentially become a threat to natural ecosystems. In theory, extensive field and experimental studies would be required to accurately and precisely determine the risks of biological invasion of a species or group of species. However, due to a lack of resources or knowledge, such critical studies are limited. As a result, biosecurity practitioners rarely have a full picture of the extent to which the exotic species has and will spread at the time of decision making. Hence, they instead opt for preventive measures such as identifying and managing potential target exotic species which are likely to be invasive or dispersal pathways through which exotic species are likely to be introduced and spread. As most of the uncertainties pertaining to biosecurity interventions lie in the resolution of data made available to practitioners at the time of decision making, we first present some of the different types of information which are readily available during the risk-assessment procedure. We then highlight how one could exploit these different resolutions of data during the risk-assessment procedure using network analysis to better understand human-mediated dispersal of exotic species. By doing so, our paper puts forward what network analysis has to offer practitioners in the context of biosecurity interventions."

This study aims to examine the effects of forest plantation area, renewable energies, real gross domestic product (GDP), and technological innovation on CO2 emissions in 9 regions of New Zealand between 2006 and 2019. For this purpose, it employs a pooled mean group methodology. Investigating the regional impacts of various variables, especially the forest area, on CO2 emissions is the main contribution of this study. The results suggest that planted forest areas can reduce CO2 emissions in the long run, but its impact in the short run is not significant. Non-renewable energy consumption is the major contributor to CO2 emissions in both the short and long run. While technological innovation and renewable energy consumption appear effective in reducing carbon emissions in the short term, they still contribute to increased CO2 emissions in the long term. At the regional level, we found that the forest plantation areas in Manawatu-Whanganui and Gisborne are important regions for reducing CO2 emissions. By taking account of these results, New Zealand should take swift action to properly manage and increase the current level of forest areas and if applicable expand them.

Our findings show that five practices, namely agroforestry, crop rotation, grass hedge/stone bunds, in-field water drainage channel, and intercropping, were practiced mainly by smallholder farmers and perceived as effective in reducing their vulnerability to climate risks. In addition, the benefits observed were linked to all five EbA practices. As a result, we can determine the suitable combination of EbA practices that fulfil the requirements of smallholder farmers, including co-benefits such as food security, adaptation advantages, and ecosystem service provisions. Such findings provide insights for developing integrated agriculture and climate change policies suitable for weather-induced disaster-prone areas such as the Savannah region."

However, farmers’ decisions to implement adaptation strategies are directly related to their perceptions of climate change risk. The current study employed a participatory workshop and household survey of 425 farmers to examine the drivers of specific climate change risks of interest (risk of loss of livelihood for farmers) and measure farmers’ level of climate change risk perception. A climate change risk perception score (CCRPS), descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, and K-means cluster analysis were used to analyze the data collected. The findings revealed that the most important changes in climate conditions affecting agricultural production in the study area were mainly the increased duration of dry spells, erratic rainfall, and an increase in extreme rainfall events. These climatic variations cause more floods and droughts, which, when coupled with socio-ecological vulnerability drivers, increase the impact of these events on agricultural livelihood, expose more farmers and their farmland, and contribute to the risk of farmers’ livelihood loss in the study area. Based on farmers’ appraisals of the occurrence of hazards, their exposure, and their vulnerability, farmers’ perceptions of climate risk have been classified into three categories: high, moderate, and low. This finding sheds some light on farmers’ climate change risk perception, which may influence their adaptation decision. These findings can be used to increase the uptake of adaptation strategies and thus the resilience of Savanna region agriculture to climate change."

While the role of women in WEF security is an essential component of these challenges, gender dimensions remain invisible in the nexus debate. This study explores the impact of gender-specific roles between female- and male-headed households on the nexus resources in the rural highlands of Ethiopia using an agent-based modeling approach. This includes capturing the gender-specific responses to modern bioenergy interventions to address current energy crises that may reduce or enhance synergies among nexus resources and whether the introduction of modern bioenergy technology would improve the quality of life for both men and women. Using the participatory gendered mental model of the food–energy–land nexus, a base ABM was developed to simulate the predicted effects under scenarios of population growth and labor reallocation. Initial simulation results show that there is low adoption of alternative bioenergy (i.e., biogas digesters), and the majority remain dependent on traditional energy sources (e.g., fuel wood and animal dung), suggesting further land degradation. Female-headed households that adopt biogas increase their burden of collecting water needed for the operation. Reallocation of labor from crop production to fuelwood collection would result in the reduction of crop yields. It is expected that male-headed households have better crop yields than female counterparts due to gender-specific roles. However, by shifting 10% of labor allocated from energy collection to crop production, yields (i.e., teff and wheat) produced by female-headed households would be comparable to their male counterparts, enhancing their food security. However, the reduced workloads for women resulting from the adoption of biogas digesters will not necessarily enhance their quality of life. This study suggests that trade-offs may arise between efficiency (in resource use) and social equity, which deserve to be further analyzed."

However, an understanding of how forest growers are reducing their risks from climate change impacts is still in its infancy. This paper applies the protection motivation theory to identify socio-psychological factors influencing forest growers’ adaptation to climate change. This study presents the survey results from 60 forest growers who have the combined responsibility for managing more than 70% of New Zealand’s plantation forests. We investigated whether their perceived response efficacy, self-efficacy and their understanding of response costs are predictors of their protective or adaptive measures. Based on our survey, risk reduction and risk spreading are the two types of protective measure frequently reported by the respondents to deal with climate risks. Consistent with the protection motivation theory, our findings show that respondents who are more likely to implement protective or adaptive measures if they perceive the threat severity to be high have high self-efficacy and resource efficacy, and exhibit low maladaptive responses such as evading and postponing behaviours. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that there is a low self-efficacy belief with strong maladaptive behaviour among the respondents that negatively influence their motivation to implement adaptation measures. This result provides guidance to policy makers, researchers and forest companies on how to make climate change adaptation efforts effective by considering the forest growers motivation to adapt to climate change."

To explore this, we conducted surveys of 60 forest growers from organisations which collectively manage more than 70% of New Zealand’s plantation forests. The results showed that 47% of the respondents perceived that climate change will affect their forest growing, and 60% perceived that climate change will increase wildfire frequency and pest and disease outbreaks. Only 21% of the respondents reported that they had taken adaptation measures directly. Lack of resources and motivation were among the barriers that respondents identified. A logistic regression analysis revealed that climate change perception, research to improve forest growers’ adaptive capacity, climate change information, forest grower age and forestry experience are significantly associated with actual adaptation decisions. Risk perceptions central to protection motivation theory (e.g. vulnerability, probability and severity) were not linked to actual adaptation decisions, suggesting that widening adaptation analyses beyond individual perceptions as predictors of climate change adaptation may provide insights for fit-for-purpose climate change adaptation policies for the sector."

Objectives: To determine the distribution of ASM remodeling in mild-severe asthma. Methods: The ASM area was measured in nine airway levels in three bronchial pathways in cases of nonfatal (n = 30) and fatal asthma (n = 20) and compared with control cases without asthma (n = 30). Correlations of ASM area within and between bronchial pathways were calculated. Asthma cases with 12 large and 12 small airways available (n = 42) were classified on the basis of the presence or absence of ASM remodeling (more than two SD of mean ASM area of control cases, n = 86) in the large or small airway or both. Measurements and Main Results: ASM remodeling varied widely within and between cases of nonfatal asthma and was more widespread and confluent and more marked in fatal cases. There were weak correlations of ASM between levels within the same or separate bronchial pathways; however, predictable patterns of remodeling were not observed. Using mean data, 44% of all asthma cases were classified as having no ASM remodeling in either the large or small airway despite a three- to 10-fold increase in the number of airways with ASM remodeling and 81% of asthma cases having ASM remodeling in at least one large and small airway. Conclusions: ASM remodeling is related to asthma severity but is heterogeneous within and between individuals and may contribute to the heterogeneous functional defects observed in asthma. These findings support the need for patient-specific targeting of ASM remodeling."

A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

Reciprocity and the sharing of an intergenerational way of life in extended family collectives is an enduring cultural obligation. For many communities, hosting large gatherings expresses customary philosophies and practices and brings families together, and food and food systems are central to these events. We partnered with two Indigenous Māori communities in Aotearoa New Zealand to explore how these communities embody resilience in their food systems. We collected data from two large pan-community gatherings or poukai in the Waikato-Tainui tribal calendar that have been held annually for more than 100 years. The first took place in a remote, rural, coastal community, Marokopa, whereas the second took place at a tribal hub, Tūrangawaewae, that frequently hosts international visitors. Most visitors were > 50 years old, consistent with the purpose of this gathering, with more women elders than men attending. At Marokopa, volunteers returned from a variety of locations, mostly by car, in contrast to Tūrangawaewae where volunteers generally lived close and either walked or drove short distances to the poukai. Gifted contributions of food and supplies from local gardens continued a history of reciprocity and connection to traditional food systems at Marokopa. At Tūrangawaewae, most provisions were store bought, but there was a strong focus on healthy eating. Both events produced little waste. Despite a shift from traditional foods and self-sufficiency in food systems, these communities demonstrate collective resilience in their motivations for hosting, cultural vitality in their expressions of manaakitanga (hosting), and a commitment to kaitiakaitanga (stewardship) in their focus on healthy foods, recycling, food waste, and intergenerational learning at these events."

In Aotearoa/New Zealand, routine developmental surveillance of preschool children is undertaken using the Before School Check (B4SC), which includes psychometric and physical health screening instruments. This study aimed to determine whether combining multiple screening measures could improve the prediction of NDDs. Methods: Linked administrative health data were used to identify NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, within a multi-year national cohort of children who undertook the B4SC. Cox proportional hazards models, with different combinations of potential predictors, were used to predict onset of a NDD. Harrell’s c-statistic for composite models were compared with a model representing recommended cutoff psychometric scores for referral in New Zealand. Results: Data were examined for 287,754 children, and NDDs were identified in 10,953 (3.8%). The best-performing composite model combining the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Parental Evaluation of Developmental Status, vision screening and biological sex had ‘excellent’ predictive power (C-statistic: 0.83) compared with existing referral pathways which had ‘poor’ predictive power (C-statistic: 0.68). In addition, the composite model was able to improve the sensitivity of NDD diagnosis detection by 13% without any reduction in specificity. Conclusions: Combination of B4SC screening measures using composite modelling could lead to significantly improved identification of preschool children with NDDs when compared with surveillance that rely on individual psychometric test results alone. This may optimise access to academic, personal and family support for children with NDDs."

We hypothesise that faecal microbiome transfer (FMT) from healthy donors would help restore the gut microbiome of individuals with AN, which in turn, may aid patient recovery. Methods We aim to conduct an open-label pilot study in 20 females aged 16-32 years in Auckland, New Zealand who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria for AN and have a body mass index 13-19 kg/m 2. We will recruit four healthy, lean, female donors, aged 18-32 years, who will undergo extensive clinical screening prior to stool donation. Faecal microbiota will be harvested from donors and double encapsulated in delayed release, acid-resistant capsules. All participants will receive a single course of 20 FMT capsules (five from each donor) which they can choose to take over two or four consecutive days. Stool and blood samples will be collected from participants over a period of 3 months to assess their gut microbiome profile, metabolome, levels of intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. Our primary outcome is a shift in the gut microbiome composition at 3 weeks post-FMT (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). We will also monitor participants' body composition (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans), eating disorder psychopathology, mental health and assess their views on, and tolerability of, treatment. All adverse events will be recorded and reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was provided by the Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee (Ministry of Health, New Zealand, 21/CEN/212). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented to both scientific and consumer group audiences. Trial registration number ACTRN12621001504808."

This survey of a nationally representative sample of schools was undertaken to identify: what well-being and mental health interventions are currently used by primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools; what gaps exist between current practice and the evidence base; what ideas staff have for improving student well-being and mental health; and what barriers staff can identify for implementing evidence-based interventions and suggestions for how these may be overcome. Forty staff from 37 (22 primary, 13 secondary and 2 composite) schools participated in semi-structured interviews. Seven key themes were identified: (1) awareness and enthusiasm about student well-being and mental health; (2) existence of specific interventions to support student well-being and mental health; (3) support for government-sponsored programmes; (4) limitations of existing programmes; (5) drivers of new interventions; (6) perceived barriers to the implementation of new interventions; and (7) suggestions for future interventions and their implementation. Currently, a wide range of primarily non-evidence based well-being and mental health interventions are delivered in a variable manner by school-based and external providers. Despite current enthusiasm by schools, there is room for improvement in the quality and equity of intervention delivery."

Psychological disorders during adolescence increase the risk of suboptimal glycemic outcomes and may lead to serious diabetes-related complications. Research shows that digital health interventions may increase access to psychological support for adolescents and improve physical and mental health outcomes for youth with diabetes. To our knowledge, there are no evidence-based, publicly available mental health apps with a focus on improving the psychological well-being of adolescents with diabetes. Objective: This study aimed to explore the acceptability and usability of our evidence-based well-being app for New Zealand adolescents, Whitu: 7 Ways in 7 Days (Whitu), to allow us to further tailor it for youth with diabetes. We interviewed adolescents with T1D and T2D, their parents, and health care professionals to explore their views on the Whitu app and suggestions for tailoring the app for adolescent with diabetes. We also explored the cultural acceptability of the Whitu app for Māori and Pacific adolescents. Methods: A total of 34 participants, comprising 13 adolescents aged 12-16 years (11 with T1D and 2 with T2D), 10 parents, and 11 health care professionals, were recruited from a specialist diabetes outpatient clinic and Facebook diabetes groups. Each participant attended one 1-hour focus group on Zoom, in person, or via phone. Researchers gathered general feedback on what makes an effective and engaging app for adolescents with diabetes, as well as specific feedback about Whitu. Transcribed audio recordings of the focus groups were analyzed using directed content analysis. Results: Adolescents with T1D, their parents, and health care professionals found Whitu to be acceptable and usable. Adolescents with T1D and their parents signaled a preference for more diabetes-specific content. Health care professionals expressed less awareness and trust of digital health interventions and, as such, recommended that they be used with external support. Due to challenges in recruitment and retention, we were unable to include the views of adolescents with T2D in this qualitative study. Conclusions: There appears to be sufficient openness to the use of an app such as Whitu for supporting the well-being of adolescents with T1D, albeit with modifications to make its content more diabetes specific. Based on this qualitative study, we have recently developed a diabetes-specific version of Whitu (called LIFT: Thriving with Diabetes). We are also planning a qualitative study to explore the views of youth with T2D and their perspectives on the new LIFT app, where we are using alternative research approaches to recruit and engage adolescents with T2D and their families."

This study aimed to better understand the association between proximity to alcohol outlets and the likelihood of young people presenting to hospital following self-harm. Methods: This was a nationwide retrospective geospatial study using data from the New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure using population-level data for 10–29-year-olds for the 2018 and 2017 calendar years. Presentations to hospital following self-harm were identified using the national minimum data set. Proximity to alcohol outlets was defined in road network distance (in kilometres) and ascertained using Integrated Data Infrastructure geospatial data. Alternative measures of proximity were employed in sensitivity analyses. Complete-case two-level random intercept logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between alcohol outlet proximity and hospital presentation for self-harm. Adjusted models included sex, age, ethnicity, area-level deprivation, urbanicity and distance to nearest medical facility. Analyses were also stratified by urbanicity. Results: Of the 1,285,368 individuals (mean [standard deviation] age 20.0 [5.9] years), 7944 (0.6%) were admitted to hospital for self-harm. Overall, the odds of presenting to hospital for self-harm significantly decreased as the distance from the nearest alcohol outlet increased, including in adjusted models (adjusted odds ratio 0.980; 95% confidence interval = [0.969–0.992]); the association was robust to changes in the measure of alcohol proximity. The effect direction was consistent across all categorisations of urbanicity, but only statistically significant in large urban areas and rural areas. Conclusions: The findings of this study show a clear association between young people’s access to alcohol outlets and presentation to hospital for self-harm and may provide a mandate for government policies and universal interventions to reduce young people’s access to alcohol outlets. Further research regarding causative mechanisms is needed."

Technologically delivered support interventions may be useful in addressing this need. Objective: This paper aimed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of “Village,” a communication app co-designed with young people and their family and friends from New Zealand. Methods: A mixed methods pilot open trial design was adopted. Participants were primarily recruited via social media advertisements and clinicians in specialist mental health services over an 8-month period. The primary outcomes were acceptability of the app (via thematically analyzed qualitative feedback and retention rates) and feasibility of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial gauged via effectiveness of recruitment methods, completion of chosen outcome measures, and occurrence of unanticipated operational issues. Secondary outcomes were app usability, safety, and changes in symptoms of depression (via the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 modified for adolescents), suicidal ideation (on the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire), and functioning (using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 or Child and Youth version). Results: A total of 26 young people (“users”) were enrolled in the trial, of which 21 recruited friends and family members (“buddies”) and completed quantitative outcome measures at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months. Furthermore, 13 users and 12 buddies also provided qualitative feedback about the app, identifying the key themes of appeal of app features and layout, usefulness of its content, and technological challenges (primarily with onboarding and notifications). Users gave Village a mean rating of 3.8 (range 2.7-4.6) out of 5 on a 5-point scale for app quality and an overall star rating of 3.4 out of 5 for subjective quality. Within this limited sample, users reported a clinically significant reduction in depressive symptoms (P=.007), but nonsignificant changes in suicidal ideation and functioning. The embedded risk detection software was activated on 3 occasions, and no additional support was required for users. Conclusions: During this open trial, Village was found to be acceptable, usable, and safe. The feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial was also confirmed after some modifications to the recruitment strategy and app."

Focusing on the media coverage before, during and after New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard’s debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, we reveal three key strategies used by journalists to frame the topic in polarizing terms: i) sourcing practices, ii) use of science, and iii) questioning of policy. Findings show that Hubbard’s voice and personal experiences were often left out of stories, replaced instead by the ‘authoritative’ voices of scientists and others (i.e., politicians, athletes, anti-trans groups) questioning her Olympic qualification and the International Olympic Committee policy for transgender athletes. Such framings prompt readers to ‘take a side’ in a polarizing debate, rather than encouraging more nuanced, ethical and empathetic responses to a complex issue. This study ultimately highlights the critical role that journalists play in controlling, shaping and/or shifting public opinion regarding the future of sport as an exclusionary or truly inclusive space."

Drawing upon interviews with 38 women from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds living in Aotearoa New Zealand, we describe the pandemic as an “arrhythmia”, a radical rupture to the familiar rhythms of their everyday social and working lives. We describe how the pandemic arrhythmia was felt in and through bodies (i.e., sleep, weight), and how women responded by creating counter rhythms (i.e., hobbies, exercise, food) as strategies to support their own and others wellbeing. Furthermore, radically disrupting linear repetitions of everyday work, social and family life, the pandemic prompted many to reflect differently upon how pre-pandemic rhythms shaped by the social, economic and gendered structures of neoliberalism were causing various forms of alienation (i.e., from their own health and wellbeing, meaningful social connections, ethical and sustainable working practices, and from pleasure). For some women, the pandemic arrhythmia was a puncturing of their normalized time-space gendered routines, leading to critique and transformation to their everyday work-life patterns. Engaging a feminist reading of rhythmanalysis, this paper brings into focus how neoliberal gender regimes are reconstituted and disrupted in the rhythms and routines of women's everyday lives. In so doing, we highlight the potential in feminist engagement with arrhythmia to extend understandings of the gendered politics of everyday life during and beyond pandemic times, and the value in such approaches for organizational scholars interested in understanding the gendered rhythms of daily life and their effects on relationships with work."

Scholars have critiqued the activewear industry for reproducing postfeminist and neoliberal discourses, with advertising and marketing primarily featuring heteronormative women’s bodies (thin, toned, white, young), with a strong emphasis on consumption and choice. In this article, we contribute to the literature on activewear and feminist consumption practices to examine how women consumers of activewear clothing understand and respond to postfeminist discourses inherent in the industry. In so doing, we speak to how the often-critiqued idealised femininity is ‘taken-up’ and interrogated by women activewear consumers. Specifically, we draw upon focus groups and interviews conducted with women from New Zealand, examining how some women are complicit in the production of particular femininities, while others are critical of the industry partaking in an array of everyday ‘acts of resistance’ against (and within) the industry. We conclude with a brief discussion of some of the women-led changes occurring within the activewear market. Ultimately, this article highlights the complexities and attitudes of some women activewear consumers and their contribution (and challenges) to the production of femininity within society."

While a range of psycho-social and practical barriers to women's participation have been identified, little research has examined how these intersect with the physiological barriers posed by birthing injuries and the physical changes wrought by pregnancy and childbirth. In this study we address this gap using data collected through in-depth interviews with 20 women in Aotearoa New Zealand seeking to engage in regular exercise following childbirth. Guided by a socio-material conceptual framework, we examine women's physical activity engagement as bio-social phenomena. We pay particular attention to how women describe and navigate challenges posed by physiological considerations such as pelvic floor dysfunction, fatigue, the energetic demands of breastfeeding, and lingering birthing injuries. We argue these physical barriers are largely glossed over by policies, programmes and existing research that focus on motivating mothers to return to or become physically active. We suggest more sophisticated conceptual approaches are needed that explicitly acknowledge the overlapping biological and social dimensions of maternal physical activity in order to better support women through the complex postpartum period and beyond through enhanced resources, information, and general social awareness."

Through our analysis and discussion, we trace embodied ways of knowing that produce wellbeing as a more-than-human entanglement, a gendered phenomenon that can be understood as an ongoing negotiation of affective, material, cultural, technological and environmental forces during a period of disruption and uncertainty."

To identify so-far unseen or understudied threats and opportunities related to climate change we applied a horizon-scanning process. First, we collated 171 threats and opportunities across our diverse fields of research. We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

Nonetheless, almost all existing coupled climate models have fixed ice sheets and lack the physics required to represent the dominant sources of Antarctic melt. These missing ice dynamics represent a key uncertainty that is typically unaccounted for in current global climate change projections. Previous modelling studies that have imposed additional Antarctic meltwater have demonstrated regional impacts on Southern Ocean stratification, circulation, and sea ice, as well as remote changes in atmospheric circulation, tropical precipitation, and global temperature. However, these previous studies have used widely varying rates of freshwater forcing, have been conducted using different climate models and configurations, and have reached differing conclusions on the magnitude of meltwater-climate feedbacks. The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) initiative brings together a team of scientists to quantify the climate system response to Antarctic meltwater input along with key aspects of the uncertainty. In this paper, we summarize the state of knowledge on meltwater discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves to the Southern Ocean and explain the scientific objectives of our initiative. We propose a series of coupled and ocean-sea ice model experiments, including idealized meltwater experiments, historical experiments with observationally consistent meltwater input, and future scenarios driven by meltwater inputs derived from stand-alone ice sheet models. Through coordinating a multi-model ensemble of simulations using a common experimental design, open data archiving, and facilitating scientific collaboration, SOFIA aims to move the community toward better constraining our understanding of the climate system response to Antarctic melt."

SSP5-8.5 forcing with fixed pre-industrial glacial melt warms all continental shelves, such that historically “cool” and “fresh” shelves transition to “warm.” Additional glacial melt, added at depth, cools the Eastern Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen seas, suggesting a negative feedback on basal melt—a novel result for a coarse resolution coupled model. From the Weddell Sea, along East Antarctica, and into the western Ross Sea—where continental shelves transition to a “warm” state—additional glacial melt increases temperatures at the continental shelf sea floor, suggesting a positive feedback. The sign of the glacial melt–subsurface temperature feedback is critically dependent on continental shelf properties, climate state, and the vertical distribution of glacial melt inputs."

Physically plausible mechanisms are added to a brine convection model that decouples chemicals from convecting brine. The model is evaluated against a recent observational dataset where a suite of qualitatively similar chemicals (poly- and perfluoroalkylated substances, PFASs) with quantitatively different physico-chemical properties were frozen into growing sea ice. With no decoupling the model performs poorly - underestimating the measured concentrations of high-chain-length PFASs. A decoupling scheme where PFASs are decoupled from salinity as a constant fraction of their brine concentration and a scheme where decoupling is proportional to the brine salinity give better performance and bring the model into reasonable agreement with observations. A scheme where the decoupling is proportional to the internal sea-ice surface area performs poorly. All decoupling schemes capture a general enrichment of longer-chained PFASs and can produce concentrations in the uppermost sea-ice layers above that of the underlying water concentration, as observed. Our results show that decoupling from convecting brine can enrich chemical concentrations in growing sea ice and can lead to bulk chemical concentrations greater than that of the liquid from which the sea ice is growing. Brine convection modelling is useful for predicting the dynamics of chemicals with more complex behaviour than sea salt, highlighting the potential of these modelling tools for a range of biogeochemical research areas."

Sea Ice Monitoring Stations (SIMS) are used to measure time series of fast-ice thickness at a location. SIMS measure ice and ocean temperature via thermistor strings with many different methods for extracting sea-ice thickness from temperature existing. This study investigates: if thickness results from temperature recorded by SIMS of different designs, and analysed with different methods are comparable; which methods are recommended for their robustness, precision and accuracy and how they compare to independent thickness measurements; how otherwise unuseable data can be salvaged through specific SIMS designs. We present an analysis of fast-ice thickness calculated from SIMS deployed in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and in the Chukchi Sea near Utqiavik, Alaska, over two decades. We find that median thicknesses derived by different methods agree within 1 ± 1.5 cm for McMurdo Sound and 2 ± 3 cm for Utqiavik. Thus, it is possible to confidently compare data collected from different stations and analysed with different methods. The vertical gradient of sea-ice temperature gives the best results for fast-ice thickness during the growth season and including standard resistors in a thermistor string can reduce potential data loss due to noise."

Particles influencing conductivity cells can also be small ice crystals (frazil) that may form in supercooled water. The detection of supercooled water depends on accurate, high precision temperature, salinity and pressure measurements. As it is currently not possible to measure salinity in situ, the standard procedure is to measure conductance over a known volume and calculate salinity. Frazil ice entrained into a conductivity cell changes the volume of conductive fluid in the conductivity cell, thus changing the conductivity, salinity and supercooling measurements. We present results on the effect of entraining microplastic into a Sea-Bird Electronics conductivity cell to simulate the effect of frazil. We show that particle volumes comparable to frazil volumes observed in the ocean change the measured conductivity and led to changes in calculated supercooling between 0.3 and 10 mK, possibly up to the same order of magnitude as naturally observed supercooling in the ocean. Further, we demonstrate that where supercooling is present, natural frazil ice concentrations can have an appreciable effect on parameters calculated with both the Equation of State of Seawater 1980 and Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 equations of state of seawater. Thus, to ensure accurate measurements in locations of very high frazil concentration, the entrainment of frazil needs to be prevented, which is not possible with methods currently available, or corrected for. An example for such a correction is given and could be modified to be applicable to other particles, for example, sediment."

One potential source of bias is combining different sampling methods in the same study. However, combining methods can be unavoidable, for instance, when sampling method selection depends upon factors such as population density or terrain. A case at hand is the use of night-time encounter catching by people or daytime catching using certified dogs for studies of Apteryx mantelli, North Island brown kiwi, in Aotearoa New Zealand. Here, we compare these sampling methods to determine whether (1) combining them risks inducing a demographic bias to the sample set, and (2) they differ in regards to blood parameters used for comparing populations (packed cell volume, glucose, plasma protein, haemoglobin). Sixty-five birds were caught during the day from their roosts using a certified dog, and 62 birds were caught at night while foraging. The results suggest that both methods capture a comparable subset of a population, with the potential exception that more very young juveniles were caught using the day method. Furthermore, no physiological effects were evident from comparing haematological parameters. We also found no difference in blood sampling success between night and day, but observed that blood extraction was more difficult at night. Hence, we demonstrate that either method, or a combination of both, can be considered for future studies. Notably, we found that night-time encounter catching had a superior success rate in very high-density populations. Since this method also negates dependency on the limited number of certified dogs, we suggest that benefits may exist through increasing the utilisation of night-time encounter catching in A. mantelli research. We suggest that future studies should consider measuring the stress levels caused by each of the methods, and quantify the effects of habitat type and terrain on sampling success."

Methods Administrative mortality (2014-2018) and census data (2013 and 2018) were used to estimate age-stratified sex-adjusted mortality rate ratios (aMRRs) for a range of mortality outcomes across the rural-urban spectrum (using major urban centres as the reference) for the total population and separately for Maori and non-Maori. Rural was defined according to the recently developed Geographic Classification for Health. Results Mortality rates were higher overall in rural areas. This was most pronounced in the youngest age group (<30 years) in the most remote communities (eg, all-cause, amenable and injury-related aMRRs (95% CIs) were 2.1 (1.7 to 2.6), 2.5 (1.9 to 3.2) and 3.0 (2.3 to 3.9) respectively. The rural:urban differences attenuated markedly with increasing age; for some outcomes in those aged 75 years or more, estimated aMRRs were <1.0. Similar patterns were observed for Maori and non-Maori. Conclusion This is the first time that a consistent pattern of higher mortality rates for rural populations has been observed in New Zealand. A purpose-built urban-rural classification and age stratification were important factors in unmasking these disparities."

Here we use national-level health data to further investigate these trends, focussing on ethnic disparities in emergency presentation prior to lung cancer diagnosis. We have also compared survival outcomes between those who had an emergency presentation in the preceding 30 days to those who did not. Materials and methods: Our study included all lung cancer registrations between 2007 and 2019 on the New Zealand Cancer Registry (N = 27,869), linked to national hospitalisation and primary healthcare data. We used descriptive (crude and age-standardised proportions) and logistic regression (crude and adjusted odds ratios) analyses to examine primary care access prior to cancer diagnosis, emergency hospitalisation up to and including 30 days prior to diagnosis, and one-year mortality post-diagnosis, both for the total population and between ethnicities. Regression models adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, rurality, comorbidity, tumour type and stage. Results: We found stark disparities by ethnic group, with 62% of Pacific peoples and 54% of Māori having an emergency presentation within 30 days prior to diagnosis, compared to 47% of Europeans. These disparities remained after adjusting for multiple covariates including comorbidity and deprivation (adj. OR: Māori 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.30; Pacific 1.50, 95% CI 1.31–1.71). Emergency presentation was associated with substantially poorer survival outcomes across ethnic groups (e.g. 1-year mortality for Māori: no emergency presentation 50%, emergency presentation 79%; adj. OR 2.40, 95% CI 2.10–2.74). Conclusions: These observations reinforce the need for improvements in the early detection of lung cancer, particularly for Māori and Pacific populations, with a view to preventing diagnosis of these cancers in an emergency setting."

Design A comparative observational study. Setting NZ; the most recent 5 years of available data on mortality events (2013-2017), hospitalisations and non-admitted hospital patient events (both 2015-2019). Participants Numerator data included deaths (n=156 521), hospitalisations (n=13 020 042) and selected non-admitted patient events (n=44 596 471) for the total NZ population during the study period. Annual denominators, by 5-year age group, sex, ethnicity (Maori, non-Maori) and rurality, were estimated from Census 2013 and Census 2018. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary measures were the unadjusted rural incidence rates for 17 health outcome and service utilisation indicators, using each rurality classification. Secondary measures were the age-sex-adjusted rural and urban incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the same indicators and rurality classifications. Results Total population rural rates of all indicators examined were substantially higher using the GCH compared with the UREP, and for all except paediatric hospitalisations when the UA was applied. All-cause rural mortality rates using the GCH, UA and UREP were 82, 67 and 50 per 10 000 person-years, respectively. Rural-urban all-cause mortality IRRs were higher using the GCH (1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.22), compared with the UA (0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.94) and UREP (0.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.68). Age-sex-adjusted rural and urban IRRs were also higher using the GCH than the UREP for all outcomes, and higher than the UA for 13 of the 17 outcomes. A similar pattern was observed for Maori with higher rural rates for all outcomes using the GCH compared with the UREP, and 11 of the 17 outcomes using the UA. For Maori, rural-urban all-cause mortality IRRs for Maori were higher using the GCH (1.34, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.38), compared with the UA (1.23, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.27) and UREP (1.15, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.19).

Importantly, there is no standardised description of each rural hospital's catchment boundary and the characteristics of the population living within this area. Aim: To define and describe a catchment population for each of New Zealand's rural hospitals. Methods: An exploratory approach to developing catchments was employed. Geographic Information Systems were used to develop drive-Time-based geographic catchments, and administrative health data (National Minimum Data Set and Primary Health Organisation Data Set) informed service utilisation-based catchments. Catchments were defined at both the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) and domicile levels, and linked to census-based population data, the Geographic Classification for Health, and the area-level New Zealand Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (NZDep2018). Results: Our results highlight considerable heterogeneity in the size (max: 57 564, min: 5226) and characteristics of populations served by rural hospitals. Substantial differences in the age structure, ethnic composition, socio-economic profile, 'remoteness' and projected future populations, are noted. Discussion: In providing a standardised description of each rural hospital's catchment boundary and its population characteristics, the considerable heterogeneity of the communities served by rural hospitals, both in size, rurality and socio-demographic characteristics, is highlighted. The findings provide a platform on which to build further research regarding NZ's rural hospitals and inform the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and equitable health care for people living in rural NZ."

It draws on interview data from twelve mathematics educators who were experienced in assessing primary students' written responses to free response prompts covering a range of topics. The first stage of the interviews used a stimulated recall protocol that followed a comparative judgment procedure in which each participant was presented with pairs of students' written responses and asked to decide which was 'better'. The second stage was semi-structured with questions about how participants made their comparative judgment decisions, and whether doing so improved their understanding of students' thinking. The findings are that assessing mathematical writing can provide educators with insights into students' representations, underlying ideas and learning trajectories, and can also provide stimulus for changing classroom practice."

This has become a widely accepted part of beliefs constructed across multiple communities about students and schools and who can do and learn mathematics successfully. A common response by policy makers and educators alike is to fix the problem of those deemed academically bleak by putting in place a range of interventions. In this article, we challenge the positioning of Pacific students as a problem to be fixed and instead focus on how we can address the practices inherent in historical forms of institutionalised racism related to colonisation. We use an Indigenous research model—Tivaevae—to develop an exemplary case study of the teachers and students from one low socio-economic urban school as they were involved in conscientisation and the reconstitution of educational practices to privilege indigenous knowledge systems. The findings highlight one model of how teachers and students can change institutionalised Western world practices in the mathematics classroom. We argue that the shift to honouring indigenous knowledge systems and a strength-based approach provided opportunities for Pacific students to learn mathematics in ways that supported them to build strong mathematical dispositions, and rather than being assimilated, retain their cultural identity."

Our exploratory study examines the mathematics education values of culturally diverse middle school students in New Zealand. We investigated how student values differed across demographic variables including school, ethnicity, gender and grades.

The overall mean ratings for each of the 14 values determined the relative value importance across the sample. One-way ANOVA assessed demographic group differences. Findings showed that respect was rated as the most important value across all student groups. Students from Pacific nations placed significantly greater importance on accuracy, communication, family and recall compared to the other ethnicities. Female students emphasized family, practice, respect, risk-taking and utility more than males. We argue that to provide equitable mathematics classrooms that support wellbeing, we need to recognize what diverse student groups value and then transform pedagogy to align with and build from students’ values.

However, the effectiveness of e-flow programs may be limited by a singular focus on ensuring adequate flow conditions at local sites, which overlooks the role of other ecological processes. Recent advances in metasystem ecology have shown that biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functions across river networks result from the interplay of local (environmental filtering and biotic interactions) and regional (dispersal) ecological processes. No guidelines currently exist to account for these processes in designing e-flows. We address this gap by providing a step-by-step operational framework that outlines how e-flows can be designed to conserve or restore metasystem dynamics.

Temporal variability in aggregate properties, like total biomass or abundance, is typically lower in communities with higher species diversity (i.e., the diversity–stability relationship [DSR]). At broader spatial extents, regional-scale aggregate variability is also lower with higher regional diversity (in plant systems) and with lower spatial synchrony. However, focusing exclusively on aggregate properties of communities may overlook potentially destabilizing compositional shifts. It is not yet clear how diversity is related to different components of variability across spatial scales, nor whether regional DSRs emerge across a broad range of organisms and ecosystem types. To test these questions, we compiled a large collection of long-term metacommunity data spanning a wide range of taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, fish, plants, invertebrates) and ecosystem types (e.g., deserts, forests, oceans). We applied a newly developed quantitative framework for jointly analyzing aggregate and compositional variability across scales. We quantified DSRs for composition and aggregate variability in local communities and metacommunities. At the local scale, more diverse communities were less variable, but this effect was stronger for aggregate than compositional properties. We found no stabilizing effect of γ-diversity on metacommunity variability, but β-diversity played a strong role in reducing compositional spatial synchrony, which reduced regional variability. Spatial synchrony differed among taxa, suggesting differences in stabilization by spatial processes. However, metacommunity variability was more strongly driven by local variability than by spatial synchrony.

However, the implications of such thermic shifts for the functioning of ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we used stream macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits to quantify the relative contribution of cold, intermediate and warm temperature-adapted taxa to changes in community functional diversity (FD) using a dataset of 3781 samples collected in Central Europe over 25 years, from 1990 to 2014. Our analyses indicated that functional diversity of stream macroinvertebrate communities increased over the study period. This gain was driven by a net 39 % increase in the richness of taxa that favour intermediate temperatures, which comprise the highest share in the community, and to a 97 % increase in the richness of taxa that favour warm temperatures. These warm temperature-adapted taxa displayed a distinct and more diverse suite of functional traits compared to the cold temperature-adapted group and thus contributed disproportionately to local FD on a per-taxon basis. At the same time, taxonomic beta-diversity declined significantly within each thermal group, in association with increasing local taxon richness. This study shows that over recent decades, small low-mountain streams in Central Europe have experienced a process of thermophilization and increasing functional diversity at local scales. However, a progressive homogenisation occurred at the regional scale, with communities converging towards similar taxonomic composition. As the reported increase in local functional diversity can be attributed mostly to the intermediate temperature-adapted taxa and a few expanding warm temperature-adapted taxa, these patterns could mask more subtle loss of sensitive cold temperature-adapted taxa with irreplaceable functional traits. In light of increasing climate warming, preservation of cold habitat refuges, should be considered a priority in river conservation."

Despite their importance, a comprehensive, global database of aquatic insect occurrences for mapping freshwater biodiversity in macroecological studies and applied freshwater research is missing. We aim to fill this gap and present the Global EPTO Database, which includes worldwide geo-referenced aquatic insect occurrence records for four major taxa groups: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (EPTO). Main type of variables contained: A total of 8,368,467 occurrence records globally, of which 8,319,689 (99%) are publicly available. The records are attributed to the corresponding drainage basin and sub-catchment based on the Hydrography90m dataset and are accompanied by the elevation value, the freshwater ecoregion and the protection status of their location. Spatial location and grain: The database covers the global extent, with 86% of the observation records having coordinates with at least four decimal digits (11.1 m precision at the equator) in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate reference system. Time period and grain: Sampling years span from 1951 to 2021. Ninety-nine percent of the records have information on the year of the observation, 95% on the year and month, while 94% have a complete date. In the case of seven sub-datasets, exact dates can be retrieved upon communication with the data contributors. Major taxa and level of measurement: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata, standardized at the genus taxonomic level.

Here, we provide a conceptual framework describing how ecological forecasts can energize and advance ecological theory. We emphasize the many opportunities for future progress in this area through increased forecast development, comparison and synthesis. Our framework describes how a forecasting approach can shed new light on existing ecological theories while also allowing researchers to address novel questions. Through rigorous and repeated testing of hypotheses, forecasting can help to refine theories and understand their generality across systems. Meanwhile, synthesizing across forecasts allows for the development of novel theory about the relative predictability of ecological variables across forecast horizons and scales.

However, patterns in temporal variability across trophic levels and the mechanisms that produce them remain poorly understood. Here we analyzed the abundance time series of spatially structured communities (i.e., metacommunities) spanning basal resources to top predators from 355 freshwater sites across three continents. Specifically, we used a hierarchical partitioning method to disentangle the propagation of temporal variability in abundance across spatial scales and trophic levels. We then used structural equation modeling to determine if the strength and direction of relationships between temporal variability, synchrony, biodiversity, and environmental and spatial settings depended on trophic level and spatial scale. We found that temporal variability in abundance decreased from producers to tertiary consumers but did so mainly at the local scale. Species population synchrony within sites increased with trophic level, whereas synchrony among communities decreased. At the local scale, temporal variability in precipitation and species diversity were associated with population variability (linear partial coefficient, β = 0.23) and population synchrony (β = −0.39) similarly across trophic levels, respectively. At the regional scale, community synchrony was not related to climatic or spatial predictors, but the strength of relationships between metacommunity variability and community synchrony decreased systematically from top predators (β = 0.73) to secondary consumers (β = 0.54), to primary consumers (β = 0.30) to producers (β = 0). Our results suggest that mobile predators may often stabilize metacommunities by buffering variability that originates at the base of food webs. This finding illustrates that the trophic structure of metacommunities, which integrates variation in organismal body size and its correlates, should be considered when investigating ecological stability in natural systems. More broadly, our work advances the notion that temporal stability is an emergent property of ecosystems that may be threatened in complex ways by biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation."

We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches.

However, while some water markets have been successful, many struggle to meet the strict institutional preconditions for efficiency and effectiveness, which has implications for social welfare and public good provision. As pressures on water resources increase, there is a growing need to consider alternative market designs that foster more cooperation between water users. Drawing on club theory and game theory, this paper investigates the economic and environmental benefits of (re)designing water markets as clubs. It finds that in small catchments, the introduction of group-level trading can increase provision of the public good, improve social welfare, and reduce free-riding when compared with a regulatory status quo. It also finds that the club model performs best when the number of active traders is low—a result that challenges the common assumption regarding group size and effective market performance. In local contexts, the group-level trading may also help characterise the optimal group size by weighing the benefits from more trading opportunities against the losses from free-riding."

Objective: In this study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on software professionals and their work practices with a focus on New Zealand. We specifically examined how software professionals and companies responded to different challenges, which is missing in the current literature. Method: We conducted an exploratory study to learn how COVID-19 challenged software professionals and their responses to these challenges. We interviewed eighteen software professionals working in different New Zealand software companies providing them an opportunity to reflect on how they and their companies faced and dealt with the pandemic. We performed thematic analysis to identify various themes from our data set. Results: We found that software professionals faced various personal, financial, and work setup-related challenges. COVID-19 impacted the productivity and workload of software professionals. It also affected the software development practices for teams, specifically for colocated teams. We observed that software professionals tried to workaround some challenges by themselves. We found that software professionals demonstrated empathy to their coworkers and supported each other during tough times. We also found that software companies facilitated software professionals in several various ways. We present a framework of the perceived responses of the software professionals, teams, and companies to various challenges they faced during the pandemic. Conclusion: Our results reveal that software professionals with specific demographics, e.g., working and single parents, contractual employees, and employees working for smaller companies, were most impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions. Our findings indicate that, through the COVID-19 pandemic, software companies trusted and empowered their employees and equipped them with the right tools and equipment and a healthy environment."

When packages are large, they often carry maintainability quality issues. In the literature, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the specific maintainability issues that occur when packages become too large. Our study fills this gap by performing relationship analysis of package size with respect to internal maintainability characteristics (coupling, cohesion, and complexity) using package-level metrics collected from 111 open-source Java projects provided in Qualitas Corpus. Our results show significantly higher maintainability issues in large packages as indicated by the maintainability metrics. We also report strong relationships of package size with cohesion (represented by the number of connected components in a package) and complexity (measured by the number of internal relationships in a package). Based on these strong associations with package size, we show that these cohesion and complexity metrics can be used to identify large package refactoring opportunities. Furthermore, we also discuss why some maintainability metrics (e.g., coupling metrics) may not be useful for refactoring large packages.

As libraries evolve and release new versions, the software systems that depend on those libraries (the clients) should update their dependencies to use these new versions as the new release could, for example, include critical fixes for security vulnerabilities. However, updating is not always a smooth process, as it can result in software failures in the clients if the new version includes breaking changes. Yet, there is little research on how these breaking changes impact the client projects in the wild. To identify if changes between two library versions cause breaking changes at the client end, we perform an empirical study on Java projects built using Maven. For the analysis, we used 18,415 Maven artifacts, which declared 142,355 direct dependencies, of which 71.60% were not up-to-date. We updated these dependencies and found that 11.58% of the dependency updates contain breaking changes that impact the client. We further analyzed these changes in the library which impact the client projects and examine if libraries have adhered to the semantic versioning scheme when introducing breaking changes in their releases. Our results show that changes in transitive dependencies were a major factor in introducing breaking changes during dependency updates and almost half of the detected client impacting breaking changes violate the semantic versioning scheme by introducing breaking changes in non-Major updates."

Prior work observed that TD Interest could be further decomposed into constituents g New Code Cost' and g Rework Cost', which gives an interesting direction of research to explore TD quantification in terms of these costs. Therefore, through our empirical study, we plan to explore the relationship between TD, New Code Cost and Rework Cost in Open-Source Software Projects.

The feedback in online channels is a recent focus for software engineering researchers, with multiple studies proposing automatic analysis tools. In this work, we investigate the product forums of two large open source software projects. Through a quantitative analysis, we show that forum feedback is often manually linked to related issue tracker entries and product documentation. By linking feedback to their existing documentation, development teams enhance their understanding of known issues, and direct their users to known solutions. We discuss how the links between forum, issue tracker, and product documentation form a requirements ecosystem that has not been identified in the previous literature. We apply state-of-the-art deep-learning to automatically match forum posts with related issue tracker entries. Our approach identifies requirement matches with a mean average precision of 58.9% and hit ratio of 82.2%.

Online software user feedback has been shown to contain large amounts of information useful to requirements engineering (RE). Previous studies have created machine learning classifiers for parsing this feedback for development insight. While these classifiers report generally good performance when evaluated on a test set, questions remain as to how well they extend to unseen data in various forms. This study evaluates machine learning classifiers’ performance on feedback for two common classification tasks (classifying bug reports and feature requests). Using seven datasets from prior research studies, we investigate the performance of classifiers when evaluated on feedback from different apps than those contained in the training set and when evaluated on completely different datasets (coming from different feedback channels and/or labelled by different researchers). We also measure the difference in performance of using channel-specific metadata as a feature in classification. We find that using metadata as features in classifying bug reports and feature requests does not lead to a statistically significant improvement in the majority of datasets tested. We also demonstrate that classification performance is similar on feedback from unseen apps compared to seen apps in the majority of cases tested. However, the classifiers evaluated do not perform well on unseen datasets. We show that multi-dataset training or zero shot classification approaches can somewhat mitigate this performance decrease. We discuss the implications of these results on developing user feedback classification models to analyse and extract software requirements."

Achieving this goal is claimed to improve, among other things, the understandability and modifiability of a design. Yet, when teaching software design, we see that students limit the amount of modularity that they introduce into their code and cannot see the benefit of further modularity. This could be because they do not understand the benefits, but it could also be that these benefits are limited for inexperienced developers. In order to teach the benefits of modularity we need to understand what, if any, benefits exist for students. We conducted a controlled experiment where 40 students performed a modification task on two different designs, one with higher modularity than the other. Students were better able to successfully complete the task with the design with higher modularity. However, we found a trend where understanding was lower for the high modularity design. These results suggest modularity is beneficial to students, and that understanding of modularity needs to be better supported when teaching software design."

Understanding the quantification of RTD is key to its management. To facilitate this understanding, we model the quantification of RTD. Our work is grounded in the literature found via a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) and informed by prior work modeling the quantification of TD for software code-related TD types. This paper reports on the SMS and the development of our model, the RTD Quantification Model (RTDQM). The key observation from our work is that, although RTD is similar in most aspects to TD in software code, it also has its own components. Requirement artifacts have a feedback loop involving the User to precisely capture User Needs. RTD Interest (i.e., additional costs due to sub-optimal decisions concerning Requirements) can incur during both Requirements Engineering and Implementation activities. Furthermore, RTD can incur regardless of the presence of software code-related TD. Similar to benefits accrued by refactoring software code, rectifying RTD can also accrue benefits."

Recent advancements in digital twins (DT) offer additional benefits to machine condition monitoring. In this study, a framework based on DT for real-time condition monitoring of industrial machines is proposed. The multi-layer DT framework consists of a physical entity (PE), virtual equipment (VE), edge device, fidelity service and digital twin services. The virtual equipment is a replica of the physical entity or the monitored machine. It also contains a cloud platform to store data online and an application to interface with the cloud enabling users to check the data remotely. The fidelity service ensures conformity between the PE and the VE. The digital service provides optimal operation and maintenance schedules based on the data from both physical and virtual spaces. The integration of the edge layer enables real-time handling of high-frequency machine data for effective health monitoring. The validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated with a case study based on monitoring a critical component of an industrial drivetrain test rig. The features of the framework allow end-users to visualize the component's real-time health status remotely."

However, conventional TF methods suffer from a limited time-frequency resolution and cross-term interferences, which limit their practical applicability in health monitoring. To address this issue, a TF image improvement method using deep learning is proposed in this paper. The proposed method employs a deep learning technique known as conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to convert a noisy low-resolution TF image of a bearing vibration signal into a noise-free high-resolution image such that the true frequency characteristics of measured signals may be revealed. In this paper, the cGAN model is trained using a simulation-based dataset generated from a bearing analytical model. The trained cGAN model is then utilized to improve TF images generated from real bearings under different fault and operating conditions. The results reveal that the proposed image improvement method generates high-resolution TF representations which are better than both the traditional TF images and those generated using TF reassignment methods."

Thus, our goal was to identify defect types detected in real-world code reviews, and the extent to which code review can be benefited from defect detection tools. Method: To this end, we classified 417 comments from code reviews of 7 OSS Java projects using thematic analysis. Results: We identified 116 defect types that we grouped into 15 groups to create a defect classification. Additionally, 38% of these defects could be automatically detected accurately. Conclusion: We learnt that even though many capable defect detection tools are available today, a substantial amount of defects that can be detected automatically, reach code review. Also, we identified several code review cost reduction opportunities."

As we converse with Cixous, weaving our own words and experiences with hers, we link her work more closely with the feminine in modern-day academia. We suggest that Cixous’s remarks on decapitation and voice offer a way forward for academic women to be; to speak; to recognise the double jeopardy of decapitation in the university; and to use laughter as a strategic, powerful, political act of resistance and subversion against oppressive masculine power structures. We draw on and seek to enact Cixous’s notion of écriture feminine—a disruptive style of writing that provides a mode of being, speaking, and writing that subverts the power of masculine norms in order to be heard and to bring possibilities for change."

Most health educators entering higher education are specialists in their clinical practice foremost, and therefore, the health researchers engaged with an education specialist to develop a project scope. Through an eight-month process of challenging, learning, reflecting, and actively testing the meaning of ideas and statements, a consensus was achieved on a research aim and proposal that would guide the research process. This paper presents the collaborative journey to achieve this consensus. The individual stories of two of the researchers’ journeys were analysed, identifying that a shift in the understanding of ontology and pedagogy takes time and effort, and change is reliant on a collective working together towards a positive outcome where consensus is arrived at through challenge and dialogue. There was an action learning phase that pre-empted the researchers’ capacity to collectively envision the research aim when working across professions, providing a practical knowing that is explored in this paper."

Eradication is often a default conservation management strategy even when it may not be feasible for a variety of reasons. Assessment of the substantive socioeconomic and ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS), both negative and positive, is increasingly viewed as an important step in management. We argue that one solution to IAS management is to align models of alien species management with Indigenous management frameworks that are relational and biocultural. We make the theoretical case that centring Indigenous management frameworks promises to strengthen overall management responses and outcomes because they attend directly to human and environmental justice concerns. We unpack the origins of the ‘introduced species paradigm’ to understand how binary framing of so-called ‘aliens’ and ‘natives’ recalls harmful histories and alienates Indigenous stewardship. Such a paradigm thereby may limit application of Indigenous frameworks and management, and impede long-term biodiversity protection solutions. We highlight how biocultural practices applied by Indigenous Peoples to IAS centre protecting relationships, fulfilling responsibilities and realising justice. Finally, we argue for a pluralistic vision that acknowledges multiple alternative Indigenous relationships and responses to introduced and IAS which can contribute to vibrant futures where all elements of society, including kin in the natural world, are able to flourish.

To identify so-far unseen or understudied threats and opportunities related to climate change we applied a horizon-scanning process. First, we collated 171 threats and opportunities across our diverse fields of research. We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

It is within such institutions and organisations, built on colonial and patriarchal values, that experiences of marginalisation, oppression and harassment have been documented. We destabilise the apparently static nature of this ‘research system monolith’ by taking up MacLeavy, Fannin and Larner's (2021) provocation of a feminist approach to boldly do leadership differently. Drawing from interviews with researchers, we argue that resistance to, and reworking of, the research system can be found in feminist modes of practice: in the everyday, mundane practices of care-full research leadership that do leadership differently."

However, large-scale tree planting in Aotearoa New Zealand has been dominated by exotic species. Although there is growing public and expert support for using native species for forest revegetation in farm landscapes, there are two key barriers. First, the lack of ecological and economic data on native species performance in different environmental conditions. Second, policy and market-related mechanisms associated with carbon sequestration, such as the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, favor the continuing use of exotic tree species, especially Pinus radiata, over native species. Consequently, there are strong incentives for exotic forests and insufficient financial support for natives, even when native forest re-establishment is often the preference of landowners, Indigenous peoples, and local communities. The AUT Living Laboratories Program is a long-term, transdisciplinary, experimental restoration research program aimed at addressing scientific, social, and economic knowledge gaps for native revegetation as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) on farmland soils. Here, we present the project design and establishment information from the three experimental restoration sites, which vary in native species composition, planting configuration, and environmental and socio-cultural context. Each site involves partnerships with Indigenous communities, specifically Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, Ngāti Manuhiri, and Ngāti Pāoa, to value and embed mātauranga Māori as Indigenous knowledge. Monitoring carbon sequestration along with changes in ecological functions and outcomes, including native biodiversity, will be critical to ensure that large-scale tree-planting aligns with the government’s strategies for climate change, native biodiversity, and economic prosperity."

We examine spatiotemporal patterns in the occurrences of tropical, subtropical and rare marine fishes in Aotearoa New Zealand to determine whether biodiversity change is occurring in this temperate region and to set a baseline for future monitoring of climate change impacts. Location: Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Taxon: Marine fishes. Methods: We consolidated 100 years of unpublished records and citizen science sightings of tropical, subtropical and rare fishes to develop a focal species database for NZ. Using hotspot analysis, we identified geographic locations where the occurrence and diversity of focal species is greater than expected. We examine the spatiotemporal variation in hotspots by focal species lifestage, habitat and taxonomic family. Results: Focal species occurrences and diversity in NZ have increased. We present 17 new-to-NZ marine fish species, and a new-to-NZ family. Focal species now account for 6.5% of pelagic fishes and 17.3% of benthic fishes in NZ. The northeast of the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) was a consistent hotspot of focal species occurrences and diversity. Hotspots of mature and pelagic fish occurrences appeared further south than juvenile and benthic species occurrences. Families with tropical affinities (Labridae and Pomacentridae) were restricted to northeastern NZ whereas hotspots of families with temperate affinities (i.e. Cheilodactylidae) extended into the South Island (Te Waipounamu). Main Conclusions: Tropical, subtropical and rare fishes are a major component of the fish biodiversity in temperate NZ, and their occurrences and diversity has increased over the past half-century. Northeastern NZ consistently has the highest occurrence rate and diversity of warmer-water fishes. Our study demonstrates the value in consolidating citizen scientist observations to detect biodiversity change, and to inform current baselines and future monitoring of climate-related biodiversity change."

Because genetic diversity can indicate species resilience to changing climate, its measurement is relevant to many national and global conservation policy targets. Many studies produce large amounts of genome-scale genetic diversity data for wild populations, but most (87%) do not include the associated spatial and temporal metadata necessary for them to be reused in monitoring programs or for acknowledging the sovereignty of nations or Indigenous peoples. We undertook a distributed datathon to quantify the availability of these missing metadata and to test the hypothesis that their availability decays with time. We also worked to remediate missing metadata by extracting them from associated published papers, online repositories, and direct communication with authors. Starting with 848 candidate genomic data sets (reduced representation and whole genome) from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, we determined that 561 contained mostly samples from wild populations. We successfully restored spatiotemporal metadata for 78% of these 561 data sets (n = 440 data sets with data on 45,105 individuals from 762 species in 17 phyla). Examining papers and online repositories was much more fruitful than contacting 351 authors, who replied to our email requests 45% of the time. Overall, 23% of our email queries to authors unearthed useful metadata. The probability of retrieving spatiotemporal metadata declined significantly as age of the data set increased. There was a 13.5% yearly decrease in metadata associated with published papers or online repositories and up to a 22% yearly decrease in metadata that were only available from authors. This rapid decay in metadata availability, mirrored in studies of other types of biological data, should motivate swift updates to data-sharing policies and researcher practices to ensure that the valuable context provided by metadata is not lost to conservation science forever."

Historical and ecological factors influence the success of colonization and subsequent diversification, leaving a signal in the genetic constitution of the diverged, range-restricted taxa. Here, we examined the historical biogeography of endemic marine fishes to quantify the role of geographical proximity and climate differences in determining colonization, and the underlying mechanisms of speciation. Location: Subtropical islands of the Southwest Pacific. Taxa: Thirty endemic marine ray-finned fishes from 17 genera. Methods: Using parametric biogeographical history models, we estimated the ancestral geographical ranges for 144 species based on time-calibrated phylogenies that included endemic species and their closest sister taxa, linking terminal nodes with geographical distribution classified into 14 biogeographical areas. Results: Ancestral range estimations revealed most species originated in Australia (66%), while only 10% and 7% originated in northern tropical Pacific locations and the East Pacific respectively, with 17% of species-range estimations being inconclusive. Vicariant events alone were identified as the most likely process shaping range evolution in 57% of the 14 best-fitting models, dispersal alone was favoured for 14% of species and both processes had a role for the remaining 29% of species. Across all phylogenies, likelihood-ratio tests confirmed that geographical distance and climatic differences constrained dispersal in 73% and 33% of species, respectively. Main Conclusions: Marine fishes endemic to subtropical islands of the Southwest Pacific originated by vicariant and jump-dispersal events mainly from ancestral populations in mainland Australia. Geographical distance and climatic differences are significant taxon-specific factors influencing the dispersal of marine fishes in the region."

Important species that comprise these ecosystems include canopy forming large brown algae (fucoids and kelp), and understorey species. Here we review current knowledge of the measured impacts of climate change stressors on New Zealand seaweeds. Ocean warming has driven increasing frequencies, durations, and intensities of marine heatwaves globally and in New Zealand. Significant negative impacts resulting from heatwaves have already been observed on New Zealand’s canopy forming brown algae (giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and bull kelp Durvillaea spp.). We predict that ongoing ocean warming and associated marine heatwaves will alter the distributional range and basic physiology of many seaweed species, with poleward range shifts for many species. Increased extreme weather events causes accelerated erosion of sediments into the marine environment and re-suspension of these sediments, termed coastal darkening, which has reduced the growth rates and available vertical space on rocky reefs in New Zealand and is predicted to worsen in the future. Furthermore, ocean acidification will reduce the growth and recruitment of coralline algae, this may reduce the settlement success of many marine invertebrate larvae. Mechanistic underpinnings of the effects of multiple drivers occurring in combination is poorly described. Finally, local stressors, such as overfishing, will likely interact with global change in these ecosystems. Thus, we predict very different futures for New Zealand seaweed ecosystems depending on whether they are managed appropriately or not. Given recent increases in sea surface temperatures and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in some regions of New Zealand, predicting the impacts of climate change on seaweeds and the important communities they support is becoming increasingly important for conserving resilient seaweed ecosystems in the future."

Recent reports of a “Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe” (QuEChERS) based method for the concurrent analysis of these thiols and their precursors via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has enabled the development of far simpler methods, as well as aligning these analyses with principles of green analytical chemistry.

The suitability of this compound as an internal standard was demonstrated by spiking model wine at normal and elevated conditions during sample preparation, with subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry showing stability of 2H213C2-γ-nonalactone. A model wine calibration, with concentrations of γ-nonalactone from 0 to 100 µg L−1, was shown to have excellent linearity (R 2 > 0.99), reproducibility (0.72%), and repeatability (0.38%). Twelve NZ Pinot noir wines, representative of a range of NZ Pinot noir–producing regions, prices, and vintages, were analysed by solid-phase extraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPE-GC–MS). The concentrations of γ-nonalactone ranged from 8.3 to 22.5 µg L−1, the latter of which was close to the odour detection threshold of this compound.

The mechanism by which these molecules prevent cancer cell growth is proposed to be through interfering with phospholipid metabolism via inhibition of PI-PLC, along with other cellular processes. Previously, 5-cinnamyl derivatives of these thieno[2-3-b]pyridines have been shown to have enhanced anti-proliferative activity compared to compounds lacking this moiety, indicating a tethered aromatic ring is important for this western region of the pharmacophore. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a library of 40 novel thieno[2-3-b]pyridine analogues containing shorter benzoyl or secondary benzyl alcohol tethers at the 5-position, in addition to various substituents on the two phenyl rings present on the molecule. Compounds bearing alcohol functionality had improved efficacy compared to their benzoyl counterparts, in addition to a 2-methyl-3-halogen substitution on the 2-arylcarboxamide ring being important for maximising anti-proliferative activity. The most potent molecules 7h and 7i demonstrated IC50 concentrations of 25–50 nM against HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells, a similar level of activity as previous thienopyridine compounds bearing cinnamyl moieties, suggesting that these novel derivatives with shorter tethers were able to maintain potent anti-proliferative activity, while allowing for a more concise synthesis."

The nano-pEV cargo consists of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which reflect the dynamic placental function during gestation. The ability to biopsy circulating nano-pEVs would aid investigations in placental functions, allowing substantial progress in obstetric care. We developed a simple and clean electrochemical methodology for the specific capture and fast release of nano-pEVs using an electrochemically switchable conducting terpolymer-functionalized carbon cloth. The conducting terpolymer was first reduced (at −0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, 30 s in PBS) to form active thiols, which could then interact with a thiolated CD63 aptamer via oxidation (+1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl, 60 s) in PBS. Conjugation of the aptamer to the conducting terpolymer-coated carbon cloth was confirmed using SEM-EDS, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. As a proof of principle, thiolated fluorescently labeled CD63 aptamers were captured and released electrochemically using this technique. Thereafter, the CD63 aptamer-modified carbon cloth showed the specific capture of nano-pEVs and their subsequent release (−0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, 120 s) following cleavage of the disulfide bond between the aptamer and the reduced terpolymer. This aptamer-modified conducting terpolymer-coated carbon cloth demonstrated good capture and release efficiencies of (2.09 ± 0.26) × 108 and (1.35 ± 0.14) × 108 particles, respectively, per 70 mm2 of the projected area of the terpolymer-coated carbon cloth. Confocal microscopy images clearly differentiated the carbon cloth fibers with captured nano-pEVs from those after the release. To the best of our knowledge, this work has developed for the first time an efficient, rapid, and straightforward methodology for the capture and release of nano-pEVs. This effective methodology could help to quickly determine fetal abnormalities, to diagnose obstetric disease and pathogenesis throughout pregnancy."

Although the presence of wine polysulfides has been demonstrated, their biogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in polysulfide formation during fermentation, with and without 5 mM cysteine supplementation as an H2S source. Using an established liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, monobromobimane derivatives of hydropolysulfides, including CysSSSH, CysSSSSH and GSSSSH, and two oxidized polysulfides, GSSG and GSSSSG, were detected in yeast cells at the end of fermentation in a grape juice-like medium. Polysulfide production by four S. cerevisiae single deletion mutants (BY4743 Δcys3, Δcys4, Δmet17 and Δtum1) showed no significant differences compared to BY4743, suggesting that uncharacterized pathways maintain cellular polysulfide homeostasis. Five mM cysteine addition increased the formation of shorter sulfur chain species, including GSS-bimane and GSSG, but did not elevate levels of longer sulfur chain species. Additionally, polysulfides with even numbers of sulfur atoms tended to predominate in cellular lysates. Oxidized polysulfides and longer chain hydropolysulfides were not detected in finished wines. This evidence suggests that these polysulfides are unstable in wine-like environments or not transported extracellularly. Collectively, our data illustrate the complexity of yeast polysulfide metabolism under fermentation conditions."

However, evidence is still lacking for what these percentage targets should be, especially for improving multiple ecosystem services. Furthermore, restoration targets can be challenging to implement across decision-making scales. We explored these challenges in the Ruamahanga Basin in the North Island of Aotearoa New Zealand, where ∼98% of wetlands have been drained. We created restoration scenarios that increase the percentage area of wetland restored at two spatial scales: first, across the entire Ruamahanga Basin, and second, using subcatchments delineated from the contributing areas of individual historical wetlands. These scales allow us to adopt the decision-making perspective of basin-scale managers/planners as well as groups/individuals restoring single wetlands. At each scale, we estimate gains and losses towards plausible targets for nitrogen and phosphorus retention, carbon storage, and agricultural productivity using the high-resolution, ecosystem service modelling tool, LUCI. At the basin scale, ecosystem service changes were incremental, showing linear trends through to full wetland restoration. We found no percentage value at which restoration did not add benefits for nutrient retention and carbon storage and no percentage value at which restoration did not detract from agricultural productivity. Within subcatchments, gains in phosphorus retention were achieved across all restoration percentages. Nitrogen retention targets were mostly met when the percentage of wetlands restored exceeded 60%. Contrasting outcomes at two different scales showed that most of the variability in ecosystem service outcomes is found at fine spatial scales, rather than at the basin scale, which has implications for choice of policy mechanisms and spatially-targeted management of ecosystem services."

Using digital tools and changes in teaching practices has created a context where Higher Education teachers must consider how future learning and teaching should occur. To explore this, a cross-discipline team used appreciative inquiry framed in complexity theory to examine how teaching in undergraduate programmes is changing in the digital age and implications for Higher Education teachers. The research identifies how digital technologies influence undergraduate programmes in Applied Statistics, Computer Science, Critical Indigenous Studies, Geography, and Information Systems. Analysis of the case studies identified how disciplinary culture, context, and technology combine to influence pedagogical practice and digital capabilities needed to teach in undergraduate programmes. We conclude that Higher Education teachers require capability in appropriate pedagogical practice that aligns with disciplinary culture and the technologies available."

Research shows that current protein intake recommendations are unlikely to meet the ageing requirements and may be linked to reduced physical function. Ensuring optimal function levels is crucial for independence and quality of life in older age. This study aims to quantify the protein intake in those over 90 years of age and determine the association between historical protein intake (2011) and subsequent physical function at ten years follow-up (2021). Eighty-one participants (23 Māori and 54 non-Māori) undertook dietary assessment 24 h multiple-pass recall (MPR) and a standardised health and social questionnaire with physical assessment in 2011 and 2021. Intake24, a virtual 24 h MPR, was utilised to analyse dietary intake. Functional status was measured using the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL), and physical performance was the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Māori men and women consumed less protein (g/day) in 2021 than in 2011 (P = 0.043 in men), but weight-adjusted protein intake in Māori participants over the ten years was not significantly reduced. Both non-Māori men and women consumed significantly less protein (g/day) between 2011 and 2021 (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively), which was also significant when protein intake was adjusted for weight in non-Māori women (p = 0.01). Weight-adjusted protein intake in 2011 was independently associated with functional status (NEADL score) in 2021 (p =< 0.001). There was no association between past protein intake and SPPB score (p = 0.993). Animal protein was replaced with plant-based protein over time. In conclusion, a reduction in protein intake was seen in all participants. The independent association between past protein intake and future functional status supports recommendations to keep protein intake high in advanced age."

This is at odds with standard mathematical models based solely on between-species interactions, which show mutualisms to be inherently unstable. Models incorporating parameters for punishment and reward strategies demonstrate that the range of conditions over which stability is observed can be extended; however, the role of community-level dynamics impacted by within-species interactions remains relatively unexplored. Here we develop a general and readily applicable approach for analysing a broad range of mutualisms. By incorporating within-species interactions, we show that mutualisms can be stably maintained across diverse environmental conditions without introducing changes to between-species interaction parameters. Further, a balance of within- and between-species interactions is sufficient to allow the persistence of mutualisms encountering ecological perturbations. Our simple and robust framework resonates with emerging empirical data highlighting the role of community-level interactions and population dynamics in maintaining mutualisms."

Reputational scoring can provide the necessary motivation via “indirect reciprocity, ” but maintaining reliable scores requires close oversight to prevent cheating. We show that in the absence of such supervision, it is possible that scores might be managed by mutual consent between the agents themselves instead of by third parties. The space of possible strategies for such “consented” score changes is very large but, using a simple cooperation game, we search it, asking what kinds of agreement can i) invade a population from rare and ii) resist invasion once common. We prove mathematically and demonstrate computationally that score mediation by mutual consent does enable cooperation without oversight. Moreover, the most invasive and stable strategies belong to one family and ground the concept of value by incrementing one score at the cost of the other, thus closely resembling the token exchange that underlies money in everyday human transactions. The most successful strategy has the flavor of money except that agents without money can generate new score if they meet. This strategy is evolutionarily stable, and has higher fitness, but is not physically realizable in a decentralized way; when conservation of score is enforced more money-like strategies dominate. The equilibrium distribution of scores under any of this family of strategies is geometric, meaning that agents with score 0 are inherent to money-like strategies."

We compare speeches by leaders from Portugal, Brazil, the United States, and New Zealand, to assess the main explicit knowledge and value bases of decision-making.

However, transparency and fairness are not limited to AI. Modern (non-AI) software is often constructed in a black box fashion. This means, components and services provide some functionality, but details on how this is achieved are hidden. Common software development and design principles like encapsulation and information hiding promote this. Engineers often only look inside the black boxes when they need to fix problems, e.g., when tracing bugs or vulnerabilities. The demand for transparency has created a need to open those black boxes also to non-engineers. For instance, businesses need to demonstrate regulation compliance, and end users want to understand how systems make fair decisions that affect them. However, adding provenance (i.e., the ability to gather information about data and algorithms used in systems) to existing systems is invasive and costly, and current approaches to collect provenance data are not designed to expose data to end users. We argue that this requires 'provenance retrofitting', i.e., adding provenance capabilities to systems mechanically, and exposing provenance data through standard language and service application programming interfaces (APIs). This could facilitate an infrastructure that supports transparency, which then can in turn be used to create feedback mechanisms for users that in the long term can improve the fairness of software. In this paper we discuss drivers, objectives, key challenges and some possible approaches to provenance retrofitting."

To investigate past vegetation and environmental change at Ngofe Marsh (‘Uta Vava’u), we examined palynomorphs (pollen and spores), charcoal (fire), and sediment characteristics (volcanic activity) from a 6.7-m-long sediment core. Radiocarbon dating indicated the sediments were deposited over the last 7700 years. We integrated the Ngofe Marsh data with similar previously published data from Avai’o’vuna Swamp on Pangaimotu Island, Lotofoa Swamp on Foa Island, and Finemui Swamp on Ha’afeva Island. Plant taxa were categorized as littoral, mangrove, rainforest, successional/ disturbance, and wetland groups, and linear models were used to examine relationships between vegetation, relative sea level change, and volcanic eruptions (tephra). We found that relative sea level change has impacted vegetation on three of the four islands investigated. Volcanic eruptions were not identified as a driver of vegetation change. Rainforest decline does not appear to be driven by sea level changes or volcanic eruptions. From all sites analyzed, vegetation at Finemui Swamp was most sensitive to changes in relative sea level. While vegetation on low-lying Pacific islands is sensitive to changing sea levels, island characteristics, such as area and elevation, are also likely to be important factors that mediate specific island responses to drivers of change."

We matched fossil pollen data with botanical status information (native, non-native), and quantified the timing, trajectories and magnitude of non-native plant vegetational change on 29 islands over the past 5000 years. We recorded a proportional increase in pollen of non-native plant taxa within the last 1000 years. Individual island trajectories are context-dependent and linked to island settlement histories.

Over the past ∼1100 years we know of two major events in the region: the Kuwae eruption which is thought to have occurred ∼500 cal. years BP and a shift to drier conditions which began ∼1100 cal. years BP. Methods: We investigated terrestrial and lacustrine ecosystem responses to these events and also to a changing fire regime, likely human-caused, using a multi-proxy (C/N, charcoal, chironomids, pollen, and tephra) record from Lake Emaotul, Efate, Vanuatu. Results: Tephra from the Kuwae eruption was found across a 6 cm layer which our age-depth model suggests was deposited 650–510 cal. years BP (95% confidence). Forest and chironomid community turnover increased during the wet-dry shift 1100–1000 cal. years BP; subsequently, chironomid turnover rates decreased again within <135 years and vegetation had partially (but not fully) recovered after ∼80 years. Following Kuwae volcanic tephra deposition, vegetation turnover increased again, reflecting a reduction in small trees and shrubs and an increase in grasses. Subsequently, the forest vegetation did not regain its previous composition, whereas chironomid community composition remained fairly stable before and after tephra deposition. Within the last ∼90 years, enhanced local burning drove another increase in vegetation turnover. Discussion: Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in Efate are sensitive to changes in hydroclimate, volcanism, and anthropogenic fires, although to different degrees; while recent human impacts are often obvious, volcanic eruptions and climatic shifts have also structured Pacific-island ecosystems and will continue to do so."

Sea Ice Monitoring Stations (SIMS) are used to measure time series of fast-ice thickness at a location. SIMS measure ice and ocean temperature via thermistor strings with many different methods for extracting sea-ice thickness from temperature existing. This study investigates: if thickness results from temperature recorded by SIMS of different designs, and analysed with different methods are comparable; which methods are recommended for their robustness, precision and accuracy and how they compare to independent thickness measurements; how otherwise unuseable data can be salvaged through specific SIMS designs. We present an analysis of fast-ice thickness calculated from SIMS deployed in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica and in the Chukchi Sea near Utqiavik, Alaska, over two decades. We find that median thicknesses derived by different methods agree within 1 ± 1.5 cm for McMurdo Sound and 2 ± 3 cm for Utqiavik. Thus, it is possible to confidently compare data collected from different stations and analysed with different methods. The vertical gradient of sea-ice temperature gives the best results for fast-ice thickness during the growth season and including standard resistors in a thermistor string can reduce potential data loss due to noise."

In the Bayesian setting, failure to allow for overdispersion leads to the posteriors for the parameters being too narrow. A simple and natural approach is to incorporate parameter heterogeneity in the model, e.g. by adding a random effect to the linear predictor. However, overdispersion can also be caused by a lack of independence, which may not be straightforward to model explicitly. In addition, there may still be some residual overdispersion after allowing for heterogeneity or lack of independence. In many settings where overdispersion is present, it is reasonable to assume that the variance of the response variable is proportional to that assumed by the model. When this is the case, we propose estimating the amount of overdispersion, and discuss the link between this estimate and the use of a posterior predictive p-value to check lack-of-fit. We also provide a residual plot that can be used to check the assumption of proportionality. We show how to use the estimate of overdispersion to make a simple adjustment to the posterior distribution for each parameter, analogous to the use of quasi-likelihood in the frequentist setting. We use two examples, regression modelling of count data and estimation of survival from a mark-recapture study, to illustrate the calculation of the estimate of overdispersion, and the resulting adjustment to the posteriors. We perform simulation studies based on the examples to assess the frequentist coverage properties of the adjusted posteriors. In both simulation studies, the adjusted posteriors lead to credible intervals that have approximately the correct coverage for a range of overdispersion scenarios. Our approach provides a new, simple and robust tool for Bayesian modelling of overdispersed data, when it is reasonable to assume that the variance of the response variable is proportional to that assumed by the model."

The key feature of the proposed model is that the sojourn times of the states in the semi-Markov chain are time-dependent, making it an inhomogeneous semi-Markov chain. Conjectured consistency of the parameter estimators is checked by simulation study using direct numerical optimization of the log-likelihood function. The proposed models are applied to a global volcanic eruption catalogue to investigate the time-dependent incompleteness of the record by introducing a particular case of IHSMMs with time-dependent shifted Poisson state durations and a renewal process as the observed process. The Akaike Information Criterion and residual analysis are used to choose the best model. The selected IHSMM provides useful insights into the completeness of the global record of volcanic eruptions, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method."

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for detecting recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reverse transcription PCR sensitivity varies over the course of an individual’s infection, related to changes in viral load. Differences in testing methods, and individual-level variables such as age, may also affect sensitivity. Methods. Using data from New Zealand, we estimate the time-varying sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR under varying temporal, biological, and demographic factors. Results. Sensitivity peaks 4–5 days postinfection at 92.7% (91.4%–94.0%) and remains over 88% between 5 and 14 days postinfection. After the peak, sensitivity declined more rapidly in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated, females compared with males, those aged under 40 compared with over 40s, and Pacific peoples compared with other ethnicities. Conclusions. Reverse transcription PCR remains a sensitive technique and has been an effective tool in New Zealand’s border and postborder measures to control coronavirus disease 2019. Our results inform model parameters and decisions concerning routine testing frequency."

To assess these rates, we conducted dilution experiments coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography and flow-cytometry in sub-Antarctic waters on and off Campbell Plateau, southeast of Aotearoa-New Zealand. Off the plateau, growth and grazing were closely balanced for all groups despite a two-fold difference between slow- and fast-growing groups. On Campbell Plateau, where HNLC conditions were alleviated, the balance was disrupted, mainly by the preferential growth of diatoms and green algae, which was stimulated beyond grazing.

Salp blooms coincide with phytoplankton dominated by diatoms or prymnesiophytes, depending on water mass characteristics. Their grazing is comparable to microzooplankton during their early bloom, resulting in a decrease of ~1/3 of primary production, and negative phytoplankton rates of change are associated with all salp locations. Particle export in salp waters is always higher, ranging 2- to 8- fold (average 5-fold), compared to non-salp locations, exporting up to 46% of primary production out of the euphotic zone. BCP efficiency increases from 5 to 28% in salp areas, which is among the highest recorded in the global ocean."

In this study, we describe the development and accessibility of an online atlas of seabed biodiversity that aims to fill these gaps. Species distribution models were developed for 579 taxa across four taxonomic groups: demersal fish, reef fish, subtidal invertebrates and macroalgae. Spatial layers for taxa distribution based on habitat suitability were statistically validated and then, as a further check, evaluated by taxonomic experts to provide measures of confidence to guide the future use of these layers. Spatially explicit uncertainty (SD) layers were also developed for each taxon distribution. We generated layer-specific metadata, including statistical and expert evaluation scores, which were uploaded alongside the accompanying spatial layers to the open access database Zenodo. This database provides the most comprehensive source of information on the distribution of seafloor taxa for Aotearoa New Zealand and is thus a valuable resource for managers, researchers and the public that will guide the management and conservation of seafloor communities. The atlas of seabed biodiversity for Aotearoa New Zealand is freely accessible via the open-Access database Zenodo under 10.5281/zenodo.7083642 (Stephenson et al., 2022)."

While studying the foraging behaviour of 26 lactating Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay during the austral spring of 2018 and 2019, we witnessed three adults and one pup investigating the cavities of Rossellidae glass sponges, with one seal visibly chewing when she removed her head from the sponge. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such behaviour. While the prey item was not identifiable, some Trematomus fish (a known Weddell seal prey) use glass sponges for shelter and in which to lay their eggs. Three of the four sponge foraging observations occurred around 13:00 (NZDT). Two of the three sponge foraging adults had higher-than-average reproductive rates, and the greatest number of previous pups of any seal in our study population, each having ten pups in 12 years. This is far higher than the study population average of three previous pups (± 2.6 SD). This novel foraging strategy may have evolved in response to changes in prey availability, and could offer an evolutionary advantage to some individuals that exploit prey resources that others may not. Our observations offer new insight into the foraging behaviours of one of the world’s most studied marine mammals. Further research on the social aspects of Weddell seal behaviour may increase our understanding of the extent and mechanisms of behavioural transfer between conspecifics. Research into the specific foraging behaviour of especially successful or experienced breeders is also warranted."

Three expeditions were carried out from RV Meteor between 2000 and 2009. Samples were taken along a latitudinal gradient spanning the Cape, Angola, and Guinea basins in the SE Atlantic and the Argentine and Brazilian basins in the SW Atlantic. The objectives of this study were to analyse patterns of epi- and suprabenthic macrofaunal density and composition at higher taxon level from epibenthic sledge (EBS) taken during the DIVA sampling campaigns and how they relate to differences in environmental conditions. In particular, the different oceanic basins are characterized by variation in surface primary productivity, sedimentary properties, and depth. We expected this difference to be reflected in the structure of the abyssal benthic communities. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found significant differences in macrofauna density between different deep-sea basins, mainly related to food availability. However, only subtle differences in community composition were observed. We found that stations in close proximity to one another showed great variability in both macrofaunal density and composition. We conclude that smaller spatial scale sampling should be paired with higher taxonomic resolution analyses of macrofaunal samples to better understand the factors contributing to variations of macrobenthic communities in the deep sea."

Location: The Hauraki Gulf/Tīkapa Moana/Te Moananui-ā-Toi, Aotearoa/New Zealand. Methods: We conducted a replicate systematic aerial survey over 12 months.

Results: We revealed that temporally dynamic variables, such as prey distribution and sea surface temperature, were important for predicting the occurrence of the study species and species groups. While there was variation in temporal and spatial distribution, predicted richness peaked in summer and was the highest in coastal habitats during that time, providing insight into changes in distributions over time and between species.

Management of this fishery according to Article II of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources aims to minimise the risk of depletion of the species that are caught as bycatch. We employed spatio-temporal models fitted to catch rate data reported by fishing vessels between 2003 and 2020 to understand the spatio-temporal abundance patterns of the major species groups caught as bycatch in the RSR Antarctic toothfish fishery. The study region consisted of the areas of the RSR where fishing has occurred since the inception of the longline fishery. The study species groups included macrourids (Macrouridae), skates (Rajiformes), icefish (Channichthyidae), eel cods (Muraenolepididae) and morid cods (Moridae). The Akaike information criterion-selected models included the effect of bottom depth and, often, also the effect of surface chlorophyll-a concentration. We found that bottom depth explained only a very small proportion of the variance in the data, while surface chlorophyll-a concentration explained very little of the variance. The predicted long-term trends of three species groups were clear: the relative abundance of macrourids has decreased, while those of skates and icefish have increased. We resampled from the predictive distributions to identify the abundance hotspots of each of the species groups, defined as the areas where long-term log-relative abundance (i.e., mean log-relative abundance over the study period) was at or greater than the average long-term log-relative abundance over the entire study region. From these abundance hotspots for the individual species groups, we developed two alternative composite hotspot indices. Both composite hotspot indices were highest on the Ross Sea continental shelf slope, between 160°E and 175°W. Our results can be used to guide the setting of bycatch limits and inform fishing vessels about bycatch species abundance hotspots in the RSR. We also recommend that future modelling studies seek to disentangle the direct and indirect impacts of the RSR Antarctic toothfish fishery on the bycatch species which are also prey of Antarctic toothfish."

The CHEMTAX approach is sensitive to the initial estimates of pigment-to-chlorophyll a (Chl a) ratios for the phytoplankton classes required, even though these are modified by the CHEMTAX process. We present an alternative chemotaxonomic method that utilizes simulated annealing with a steepest descent algorithm to derive class abundances and pigment-to-Chl a ratios. The simulated annealing algorithm is tested on two synthetic datasets of Southern Ocean phytoplankton communities. Each dataset is composed of 1000 inversion samples (set of phytoplankton class abundances, pigment ratios, and pigment profiles) with sizes ranging between 5 and 60 individual samples. We show that the new simulated annealing approach displays higher accuracy than two common configurations of the CHEMTAX method, with lower differences between true and estimated class abundances. Symmetric mean absolute percentage error were 4.8–11%, compared to 18–70% with CHEMTAX approaches. Proportions of variance explained (R2) between true and estimated class abundances using the simulated annealing approach were 0.98–0.99 compared to 0.71–0.89 for CHEMTAX.

To understand variability within the STF east of New Zealand, we assessed phytoplankton community structure, growth, and grazing dynamics in relation to physico-chemical conditions across 23 stations distributed along the Chatham Rise region during late autumn-early winter. Serial dilution experiments were coupled with size-fractionated chlorophyll a (Chla) analysis (Total and <20 μm) and flow-cytometry (Synechococcus and picoeukaryote numbers, <2 μm) to estimate phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates. Within the broad STF zone, subantarctic influenced waters (SAIW), frontal zone (FZ), and subtropical influenced waters (STIW) were delimited based on salinity, temperature and nutrient gradients. The chlorophyll a biomass (TChla) of phytoplankton and the abundance of larger sized cells (>20 μm chlorophyll a) peaked in FZ waters but declined steadily southwards into the colder SAIW, and rapidly reduced north into the STIW. Chlorophyll a <2 μm peaked in the northern STIW. Phytoplankton growth (TChla) was higher in warmer STIW (μ = 0.49 ± 0.07 day−1) than in iron limited SAIW (μ = 0.29 ± 0.06 day−1) but was on average moderate (μ = 0.42 ± 0.05 day−1) when compared to previous studies in the region. Microzooplankton grazing on TChla was lower (m = 0.17 ± 0.04 day−1) than growth and accounted for half of daily primary production (m:μ, 0.47 ± 0.06). Growth in the <20 μm Chla size fraction was higher (μ = 0.52 ± 0.06 day−1) but a larger proportion was consumed by microzooplankton (m:μ = 0.64 ± 0.06). Picoeukaryotes showed the fastest growth (1.49 ± 0.13 day−1) and grazing (1.43 ± 0.11 day−1) rates on average, which peaked in the FZ but remained closely balanced across different waters (m:μ = 1.00 ± 0.02). Conversely, Synechococcus rates peaked in STIW and decreased southwards, with growth (μ = 0.42 ± 0.08 day−1) generally exceeding grazing (m = 0.28 ± 0.06 day−1) across all regions. Our results indicate differences in grazing together with nutrient (likely iron) availability were the primary factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics in the STF zone. These factors also affected the accumulation of larger phytoplankton biomass in the FZ, including the potential for export or transfer to higher trophic levels."

However, the response of macroalgal assemblages to changes in the quality (spectral composition) of light as compared to the quantity alone is poorly understood. Here, we bridge radiative transfer modeling and algal physiology to simulate the underwater light environment and explore macroalgal responses to spectral attenuation by various coastal water constituents. We considered three groups of macroalgal taxa (class Phaeophyceae and, phyla Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta) for which we developed a “synthetic envelope” of spectrally resolved action spectra using 1 million radiative simulations. We found that brown algae were more efficient at harvesting light across the whole spectrum at low attenuation (< 0.2 m−1) when depths were greater than 10 m, whereas green algae dominated shallower depths than 10 m for low to high attenuation values. Finally, red algae made best use of the available light at relatively higher attenuation values (> 0.2 m−1) and deeper depths. We also demonstrated that the brown and green algal taxa showed higher photosynthetic efficiencies when attenuation was dominated by particulate matter rather than by phytoplankton or detrital matter. Our results shed new light on the “Complementary Chromatic Adaptation” hypothesis by confirming that algal pigmentation matters under a subset of scenarios, particularly at the limits of light availability in coastal waters. This study paves the way for identifying competitive thresholds in macroalgal communities by using satellite-derived ocean color products to identify regions and depths of potential optical transitions."

Most MHW studies have focused on summer events in specific regions or global open-water analyses with little consideration to seasonality or spatial biogeography of the nearshore zone. We address this research gap by analysing changes to MHWs across seasons and ecoregions, within 12 nautical miles (NM) of New Zealand’s coastline, an area with high biodiversity and endemism. We used season-specific linear trend analysis with temporal breakpoints between 1982 and 2021 to identify the number of MHW events and MHW days, and mean, maximum, and cumulative intensity of MHWs for New Zealand coastal ecoregions. Across ecoregions, 69.5% of 200 trend analyses increased significantly whereas the remaining 30.5% were unaffected. For the significant increases, temporal breakpoints occurred between 1994 and 2012. We conclude that MHWs have become stronger, longer and more frequent across coastal New Zealand, but with some variability within and between regions. Our trend-analyses could enable retrospective analyses of biological tipping-points and inform management practices that may enhance the resilience of ecoregions yet to face MHW breakpoints or those in the initial stages of major climatic changes."

In New Zealand all sea turtles are protected, but there are currently no fisheries bycatch mitigation measures. We describe fishery captures of leatherbacks from Ministry observer and fisher self-reported data. A generalized additive model (GAM) was then used to evaluate which factors might explain the observed year trend in captures. Between fishing years 2007–08 and 2020–21 (years starting 1 October), there were 217 captures of leatherback turtles, an annual average of 15.5. Reported captures increased substantially to 50 in 2020–21. Nearly all (97.7%) captures were reported from surface longline fisheries. Because of sparse observer coverage most captures (85.3%) were self-reported by fishers. Within the main fishery, just 9.4% of the vessels reported 94.5% of the leatherback captures, and one vessel reported 40.4% of all captures. Some non-reporting of captures seems likely. The GAM estimated a higher probability of capture with increasing SST from a constant-over-time spatial pattern of monthly sea surface temperature, and predicted the increase in captures in 2020–21. Much of the increase in bycatch could therefore be explained by the fleet moving into warmer areas where the probability of leatherback capture was higher.

Results show direct evidence of plant translocations, crop production, and wild plant gathering consistent with ethnographic accounts, with samples dating from the settlement period (thirteenth century AD) through to western contact. Four Polynesian translocations are identified: Colocasia esculenta, a second possible Araceae, Musa sp., and Cordyline fruticosa. Another three taxa include potentially both translocated and native varieties: Cocos nucifera, Pandanus tectorius, and Morinda citrifolia. Several lines of evidence are brought to bear on the C. esculenta identifications. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to obtain images of higher magnification and resolution relative to light microscopy of the mostly degraded starch. Elemental analysis of raphides, embedded in cf. C. esculenta starch masses, confirms the presence of calcium, providing further evidence that this smallest of Pacific cultigen starch is C. esculenta. Xylem and phenolic inclusions consistent with this species are also identified. As plant taxa vary considerably in their production and preservation of different tissue types, the study shows the value of combined plant microfossil approaches."

Methods We conducted this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving children 1 to 3 years of age with peanut allergy confirmed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Patients who had an eliciting dose (the dose necessary to elicit an allergic reaction) of 300 mg or less of peanut protein were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive epicutaneous immunotherapy delivered by means of a peanut patch (intervention group) or to receive placebo administered daily for 12 months. The primary end point was a treatment response as measured by the eliciting dose of peanut protein at 12 months. Safety was assessed according to the occurrence of adverse events during the use of the peanut patch or placebo. Results Of the 362 patients who underwent randomization, 84.8% completed the trial. The primary efficacy end point result was observed in 67.0% of children in the intervention group as compared with 33.5% of those in the placebo group (risk difference, 33.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 22.4 to 44.5; P<0.001). Adverse events that occurred during the use of the intervention or placebo, irrespective of relatedness, were observed in 100% of the patients in the intervention group and 99.2% in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 8.6% of the patients in the intervention group and 2.5% of those in the placebo group; anaphylaxis occurred in 7.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 0.4% of patients in the intervention group and none in the placebo group. Treatment-related anaphylaxis occurred in 1.6% in the intervention group and none in the placebo group. Conclusions In this trial involving children 1 to 3 years of age with peanut allergy, epicutaneous immunotherapy for 12 months was superior to placebo in desensitizing children to peanuts and increasing the peanut dose that triggered allergic symptoms.

Purpose: To explore potential moderators, mediators, and prognostic indicators of the effect of hip arthroscopy and physical therapy on change in 33-item international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) score for FAI syndrome. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Overall, 99 participants were recruited from the clinics of orthopaedic surgeons and randomly allocated to treatment with hip arthroscopy or physical therapy. Change in iHOT-33 score from baseline to 12 months was the dependent outcome for analyses of moderators, mediators, and prognostic indicators. Variables investigated as potential moderators/prognostic indicators were demographic variables, symptom duration, alpha angle, lateral center-edge angle (LCEA), Hip Osteoarthritis MRI Scoring System (HOAMS) for selected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) score. Potential mediators investigated were change in chosen bony morphology measures, HOAMS, and dGEMRIC score from baseline to 12 months. For hip arthroscopy, intraoperative procedures performed (femoral ostectomy ± acetabular ostectomy ± labral repair ± ligamentum teres debridement) and quality of surgery graded by a blinded surgical review panel were investigated for potential association with iHOT-33 change. For physical therapy, fidelity to the physical therapy program was investigated for potential association with iHOT-33 change. Results: A total of 81 participants were included in the final moderator/prognostic indicator analysis and 85 participants in the final mediator analysis after exclusion of those with missing data. No significant moderators or mediators of change in iHOT-33 score from baseline to 12 months were identified. Patients with smaller baseline LCEA (β = −0.82; P =.034), access to private health care (β = 12.91; P =.013), and worse baseline iHOT-33 score (β = −0.48; P <.001) had greater iHOT-33 improvement from baseline to 12 months, irrespective of treatment allocation, and thus were prognostic indicators of treatment response. Unsatisfactory treatment fidelity was associated with worse treatment response (β = −24.27; P =.013) for physical therapy. The quality of surgery and procedures performed were not associated with iHOT-33 change for hip arthroscopy (P =.460-.665 and P =.096-.824, respectively). Conclusion: No moderators or mediators of change in hip-related quality of life were identified for treatment of FAI syndrome with hip arthroscopy or physical therapy in these exploratory analyses. Patients who accessed the Australian private health care system, had smaller LCEAs, and had worse baseline iHOT-33 scores, experienced greater iHOT-33 improvement, irrespective of treatment allocation."

However, simulation uptake in construction is lagging due to several challenges such as the extensive data requirements and modelling efforts in a simulation study. This paper aims at addressing this gap by introducing a framework that integrates the practices of simulation modelling with the Last Planner® System (LPS), which is a well-established production planning and control method. The framework focuses on exploiting the outputs of implementing the LPS to support building a valid simulation model. A case study is conducted to test the applicability of the proposed framework. Based on the findings of the study, it can be concluded that the LPS provides a promising avenue for integration with simulation modelling due to the shared processes and requirements between both methods, which may lead to minimised data requirements and modelling efforts for simulation, thus improving simulation uptake in the construction industry."

We note that this pandemic virus looks likely to result in future waves of infection that diminish in size over time, depending on such factors as viral evolution and population immunity. However, the burden of disease remains high with thousands of infections, hundreds of hospitalisations and tens of deaths each week, and an unknown burden of long-term illness (long COVID). Alongside this there is a considerable burden from other important respiratory illnesses, including influenza and RSV, that needs more attention. Given this impact and the associated health inequities, particularly for Māori and Pacific Peoples, we consider that an ongoing respiratory disease mitigation strategy is appropriate for New Zealand. As such, the previously described ""vaccines plus"" approach (involving vaccination and public health and social measures), should now be integrated with the surveillance and control of other important respiratory infections. Now is also a time for New Zealand to build on the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance preparedness nationally and internationally. New Zealand's experience suggests elimination (or ideally exclusion) should be the default first choice for future pandemics of sufficient severity."

In late 2021, high vaccine coverage enabled the country to transition away from the elimination strategy to a mitigation strategy. However, given negligible levels of immunity from prior infection, this required careful planning and an effective public health response to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and unmanageable health impacts. Here, we develop an age-structured model for the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 including the effects of vaccination, case isolation, contact tracing, border controls and population-wide control measures. We use this model to investigate how epidemic trajectories may respond to different control strategies, and to explore trade-offs between restrictions in the community and restrictions at the border. We find that a low case tolerance strategy, with a quick change to stricter public health measures in response to increasing cases, reduced the health burden by a factor of three relative to a high tolerance strategy, but almost tripled the time spent in national lockdowns. Increasing the number of border arrivals was found to have a negligible effect on health burden once high vaccination rates were achieved and community transmission was widespread."

New Omicron subvariants have subsequently emerged with a significant growth advantage over the previously dominant BA.2. We investigated a mathematical model that included waning of vaccine-derived and infection-derived immunity, as well as the impact of the BA.5 subvariant which began spreading in New Zealand in May 2022. The model was used to provide scenarios to the New Zealand Government with differing levels of BA.5 growth advantage, helping to inform policy response and healthcare system preparedness during the winter period. In all scenarios investigated, the projected peak in new infections during the BA.5 wave was smaller than in the first Omicron wave in March 2022. However, results indicated that the peak hospital occupancy was likely to be higher than in March 2022, primarily due to a shift in the age distribution of infections to older groups.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for detecting recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reverse transcription PCR sensitivity varies over the course of an individual’s infection, related to changes in viral load. Differences in testing methods, and individual-level variables such as age, may also affect sensitivity. Methods. Using data from New Zealand, we estimate the time-varying sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR under varying temporal, biological, and demographic factors. Results. Sensitivity peaks 4–5 days postinfection at 92.7% (91.4%–94.0%) and remains over 88% between 5 and 14 days postinfection. After the peak, sensitivity declined more rapidly in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated, females compared with males, those aged under 40 compared with over 40s, and Pacific peoples compared with other ethnicities. Conclusions. Reverse transcription PCR remains a sensitive technique and has been an effective tool in New Zealand’s border and postborder measures to control coronavirus disease 2019. Our results inform model parameters and decisions concerning routine testing frequency."

Yet fish are an important source of food and support the lives of many people in coastal communities. This paper considers an idea that a moderate intensity of fishing, appropriately scaled across species, could help in maintaining biodiversity, rather than reducing it. The scaling comes from an intuition that rates of fishing mortality of species should be kept in line with production rates of the species, a notion known as balanced harvesting. This places species conservation and exploitation on an equal footing in a single equation, showing quantitatively the relative levels of fishing mortality that species of different abundance can support. Using a dynamic model of a marine ecosystem, we give numerical evidence showing for the first time that fishing, if scaled in this way, can protect rarer species, while allowing some exploitation of species with greater production. This works because fishing mortality rates, when scaled by production, are density-dependent. Such fishing, operating adaptively to follow species' production rates over time, contains a feedback that would help to protect species from overfishing in the presence of uncertainty about how marine ecosystems work."

We have genetically identified and characterised the first vic locus in the economically important, plant-pathogenic, necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. A bulked segregant approach coupled with whole genome Illumina sequencing of near-isogenic lines of B. cinerea was used to map a vic locus to a 60-kb region of the genome. Within that locus, we identified two adjacent, highly polymorphic open reading frames, Bcvic1 and Bcvic2, which encode predicted proteins that contain domain architectures implicated in vegetative incompatibility in other filamentous fungi. Bcvic1 encodes a predicted protein containing a putative serine esterase domain, a NACHT family of NTPases domain, and several Ankyrin repeats. Bcvic2 encodes a putative syntaxin protein containing a SNARE domain; such proteins typically function in vesicular transport. Deletion of Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 individually had no effect on vegetative incompatibility. However, deletion of the region containing both Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 resulted in mutant lines that were severely restricted in growth and showed loss of vegetative incompatibility. Complementation of these mutants by ectopic expression restored the growth and vegetative incompatibility phenotype, indicating that Bcvic1 and Bcvic2 are controlling vegetative incompatibility at this vic locus."

We leverage extensive long-term metadata to quantify genome-wide diversity of the species over time and present new approaches using probabilistic programming, combined with a phenotype dataset spanning five decades, to disentangle phenotypic variance into environmental and genetic effects while quantifying uncertainty in small populations. We find associations for growth, disease susceptibility, clutch size and egg fertility within genic regions previously shown to influence these traits in other species. Finally, we generate breeding values to predict phenotype and illustrate that active management over the past 45 years has maintained both genome-wide diversity and diversity in breeding values and, hence, evolutionary potential.

Reciprocity and the sharing of an intergenerational way of life in extended family collectives is an enduring cultural obligation. For many communities, hosting large gatherings expresses customary philosophies and practices and brings families together, and food and food systems are central to these events. We partnered with two Indigenous Māori communities in Aotearoa New Zealand to explore how these communities embody resilience in their food systems. We collected data from two large pan-community gatherings or poukai in the Waikato-Tainui tribal calendar that have been held annually for more than 100 years. The first took place in a remote, rural, coastal community, Marokopa, whereas the second took place at a tribal hub, Tūrangawaewae, that frequently hosts international visitors. Most visitors were > 50 years old, consistent with the purpose of this gathering, with more women elders than men attending. At Marokopa, volunteers returned from a variety of locations, mostly by car, in contrast to Tūrangawaewae where volunteers generally lived close and either walked or drove short distances to the poukai. Gifted contributions of food and supplies from local gardens continued a history of reciprocity and connection to traditional food systems at Marokopa. At Tūrangawaewae, most provisions were store bought, but there was a strong focus on healthy eating. Both events produced little waste. Despite a shift from traditional foods and self-sufficiency in food systems, these communities demonstrate collective resilience in their motivations for hosting, cultural vitality in their expressions of manaakitanga (hosting), and a commitment to kaitiakaitanga (stewardship) in their focus on healthy foods, recycling, food waste, and intergenerational learning at these events."

ISMIP6 highlighted the different behaviors of the East and West Antarctic ice sheets, as well as the possible role of increased surface mass balance in offsetting the dynamic ice loss in response to changing oceanic conditions in ice shelf cavities. However, the detailed contribution of individual glaciers, as well as the partitioning of uncertainty associated with this ensemble, have not yet been investigated. Here, we analyze the ISMIP6 results for high carbon emission scenarios, focusing on key glaciers around the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and we quantify their projected dynamic mass loss, defined here as mass loss through increased ice discharge into the ocean in response to changing oceanic conditions. We highlight glaciers contributing the most to sea level rise, as well as their vulnerability to changes in oceanic conditions. We then investigate the different sources of uncertainty and their relative role in projections, for the entire continent and for key individual glaciers. We show that, in addition to Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers in West Antarctica, Totten and Moscow University glaciers in East Antarctica present comparable future dynamic mass loss and high sensitivity to ice shelf basal melt. The overall uncertainty in additional dynamic mass loss in response to changing oceanic conditions, compared to a scenario with constant oceanic conditions, is dominated by the choice of ice sheet model, accounting for 52 % of the total uncertainty of the Antarctic dynamic mass loss in 2100. Its relative role for the most dynamic glaciers varies between 14 % for MacAyeal and Whillans ice streams and 56 % for Pine Island Glacier at the end of the century. The uncertainty associated with the choice of climate model increases over time and reaches 13 % of the uncertainty by 2100 for the Antarctic Ice Sheet but varies between 4 % for Thwaites Glacier and 53 % for Whillans Ice Stream. The uncertainty associated with the ice–climate interaction, which captures different treatments of oceanic forcings such as the choice of melt parameterization, its calibration, and simulated ice shelf geometries, accounts for 22 % of the uncertainty at the ice sheet scale but reaches 36 % and 39 % for Institute Ice Stream and Thwaites Glacier, respectively, by 2100. Overall, this study helps inform future research by highlighting the sectors of the ice sheet most vulnerable to oceanic warming over the 21st century and by quantifying the main sources of uncertainty."

Enhanced surface melt will impact the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) and, through dynamic feedbacks, induce changes in global mean sea level (GMSL). However, the current understanding of surface melt in Antarctica remains limited in terms of the uncertainties in quantifying surface melt and understanding the driving processes of surface melt in past, present and future contexts. Here, we construct a novel grid-cell-level spatially distributed positive degree-day (PDD) model, forced with 2 m air temperature reanalysis data and spatially parameterized by minimizing the error with respect to satellite estimates and surface energy balance (SEB) model outputs on each computing cell over the period 1979 to 2022. We evaluate the PDD model by performing a goodness-of-fit test and cross-validation. We assess the accuracy of our parameterization method, based on the performance of the PDD model when considering all computing cells as a whole, independently of the time window chosen for parameterization. We conduct a sensitivity experiment by adding ±10 % to the training data (satellite estimates and SEB model outputs) used for PDD parameterization and a sensitivity experiment by adding constant temperature perturbations (+1, +2, +3, +4 and +5 °C) to the 2 m air temperature field to force the PDD model. We find that the PDD melt extent and amounts change analogously to the variations in the training data with steady statistically significant correlations and that the PDD melt amounts increase nonlinearly with the temperature perturbations, demonstrating the consistency of our parameterization and the applicability of the PDD model to warmer climate scenarios. Within the limitations discussed, we suggest that an appropriately parameterized PDD model can be a valuable tool for exploring Antarctic surface melt beyond the satellite era."

Ice sheet variability at similar frequencies is comparatively less known and understood prior to the Quaternary during times, where higher atmospheric pCO2 and warmer climates prevailed, and continental-scale ice sheets were largely restricted to Antarctica. In this study, we evaluate a high-resolution clast abundance dataset (ice-rafted debris) that captures East Antarctic ice sheet variability in the western Ross Sea during the early Miocene. This dataset is derived from a 100 m-thick mudstone interval in the ANtarctic DRILLing (ANDRILL or AND) core 2A, which preserves a record of precession and eccentricity variability. The sedimentation rates are of appropriate resolution to also characterize the signature of robust, subprecession cyclicity. Strong sub-precession (~10 kyr) cyclicity is observed, with an amplitude modulation in lockstep with eccentricity, indicating a relationship between high-frequency Antarctic ice sheet dynamics and astronomical forcing. Bicoherence analysis indicates that many of the observed millennial-scale cycles (as short as 1.2 kyr) are associated with nonlinear interactions (combination or difference tones) between each other and the Milankovitch cycles. The presence of these cycles during the Miocene reveals the ubiquity of millennial-scale ice sheet variability and sheds light on the interactions between Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, and ice in climates warmer than the Quaternary."

Three locations were continuously cored (79% recovery) to a maximum depth of 50.48 m through a succession of interbedded till sheets and fossil-bearing, fluvio-lacustrine sediments. A composite chronostratigraphic framework is presented for the cores based on the previous mapping, a seismic refraction survey that defines basin geometry, and a new, integrated age model based on paleomagnetic stratigraphy that is constrained by radioisotopic 40Ar/39Ar numeric ages on two newly identified silicic tephra. The paleoecologic and sedimentologic characteristics of organic-rich lithologies are relatively consistent up-section, which implies that successively younger interglacial deposits during the MMCT represented broadly similar environmental and climatic conditions. During these interglacials, the Friis Hills hinterland was likely ice-free. Major disconformities in the section suggest a transition to colder climates, and after ca. 14.6 Ma, thicker, more extensive and erosive ice cover occurred across the Friis Hills during glacial episodes. Diamictites in the upper three cycles suggest that climate cooled and became drier after ca. 14.2 Ma. However, cyclical retreat of the ice and a return to warm climate conditions during interglacials continued through ca. 13.9 Ma. These direct records reflect a highly variable East Antarctic Ice Sheet margin but show that the ice margin became progressively more extensive during successive glacial intervals, which is consistent with a cooling trend toward more glacial values in the far-field benthic foraminifera δ18O proxy ice volume and temperature record. Age constraints show that glacial-interglacial variability at the terrestrial margin of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was primarily paced by astronomical precession (~23 k.y.) through the onset of the MMCT (15–14.7 Ma). Precession-driven cycles are modulated by short-period (~100 k.y.) eccentricity cycles. Intervals of maximum eccentricity (high seasonality) coincide with sedimentary cycles comprising thin diamictites and relatively thick interglacial sandstone and mudstone units. Intervals of minimum eccentricity (low seasonality) coincide with sedimentary cycles comprising thick diamictites and relatively thin interglacial sedimentary deposits. Major disconformities in the Friis Hills succession that span more than ~100 k.y. reflect episodes of expansion of erosive ice across, and well beyond, the Transantarctic Mountains and coincide with nodes in eccentricity (~400 k.y.). These relationships suggest that during relatively warm intervals in the middle Miocene, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet expanded and contracted over 100 k.y. cycles, while its margins continued to fluctuate at higher (~23 k.y.) frequency. After 14.5 Ma, obliquity is the dominant frequency in δ18O records, marking a period during which large regions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet grounded in marine environments"

In particular, an increasing amount of large-scale DC load and generation is expected to be connected to the distribution system, especially at the MV level. Thus, adoption of new grid topologies is required and among others, hybrid AC/DC networks have emerged as an attractive pathway to meet new grid operational requirements. This paper evaluates future hybrid AC/DC distribution systems at the MV level, considering potential network topologies and new technologies. Steady-state analysis is performed to compare five topologies of hybrid MV AC/DC networks. Key technologies for such hybrid grids such as voltage source converters and fast charging stations are considered. The results provide quantitative comparisons between topologies regarding large-scale DC load and generation integration capability, contingency operation, sensitivity analysis. Several challenges presented to the protection and fault location that are caused by the adoption of new topologies are also identified. The topologies are compared by network losses, voltage and power factor constraints, analysing the different benefits and drawbacks of the hybrid AC/DC topologies."

Individuals' physical and physiological status can be constantly monitored, and numerous data can be collected through wearable and mobile devices. However, the silo of individual data brings limitations to existing machine learning approaches to correctly identify a user's health status. Distributed machine learning paradigms, such as federated learning, offer a potential solution for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing without sending raw personal data. However, federated learning is vulnerable to harmful participants that can degrade the overall model quality by sharing low-quality data. Therefore, it is critical to select suitable participants to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning. In this article, a unique clustering-based approach is proposed to use social context data for participant selection. Different edge participant groups will be established, and group-specific federated learning will be performed. The models of various edge groups will be further aggregated to strengthen the robustness of the global model. The experimental results demonstrated that through participant selection, clustering-based hierarchical federated learning can achieve better results with less participants in two different IoMT applications for ECG and human motion monitoring. This shows the efficacy of the proposed method in improving federated learning performance and efficiency in various IoMT applications."

Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, holds great promise as a region with high solar potential. Yet, it is susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides, and floods. This research aims to identify the most suitable solar farm location in Hawkes Bay by integrating estimated solar energy production with disaster risk assessment. The study employs a two-stages multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, combining data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), alongside the utilization of geographical information system (GIS) technology. The finding, among 15 candidate locations, the area in a 5 km radius of Te Haroto weather station has the most potential for solar PV farms. 82 % of the location has low disaster risk, and only 7% of the area is considered high risk."

Findings: This paper’s main contribution shows that while there is a divine and profane divide, social agents, given their agency, can move back and forth from one side of the divide to the other. Accounting as a control device does not include features such as faith, which is helpful for decision-making; accordingly, religion is relied upon when it comes to decision-making. In contrast, accounting has features that are useful for stewardship purposes. Accordingly, when it comes to the church’s stewardship function accounting in the form of financial reports is relied upon. Research limitations/implications: Pacific Island culture almost permeates all facets of life, including church life; however, this study did not clarify this. Later studies can explore the implications of culture on the deployment of accounting in a religious setting. Practical implications: This rich empirical study describes the control dynamics and the tension between accounting and religion in a religious organisation. Accounting needs to adapt to churches’ unique characteristics, whereby religious/doctrinal beliefs must be accounted for and respected. Unlike in the corporate world, accountants in churches cannot fully practice their training or exercise the kind of influence they usually hold in organisations due to their religious belief systems. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of a few studies on the religion-accounting relationship. While the focus of earlier studies was generally on a secular and sacred divide, this study looks at coexisting of accounting and religion. This study adds to the sparse literature on accounting and religion and their controlling influence."

Prior research has primarily focused on examining antecedents that affect professional skepticism. Yet, little is known about auditors’ perceptions and experiences of exercising professional skepticism in everyday audit practice. Through analyzing 78 stories collected from interviewing 35 auditors, our research finds that exercising professional skepticism constitutes a sensemaking process that involves noticing discrepant cues, creating interpretations, and arguing with clients to give sense. Within this process, professional skepticism is constructed by auditors’ microlevel actions and interactions in their collective efforts to seek and interpret meanings of discrepant cues. Prior studies highlight the cognitive and psychological nature of professional skepticism at an individual level. Our study provides an incremental understanding of how professional skepticism is enacted and collectively constructed by auditors in practice and shows that the meanings and practices of professional skepticism are fluid and emergent."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ critical reflections are informed by the literature and websites of IASB, International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), global reporting initiative (GRI) and other relevant organisations. The authors use Bourdieu’s concept of field to support their analysis and critique. Findings: The authors highlight how a disrupted standard-setting field will be a distraction from efforts to address real sustainability issues and concerns. Determining the “legitimate” sustainability reporting standards is likely to be an outcome of struggles between occupants in the sustainability standard-setting field. Accordingly, the shape of legitimate standards will be defined by those with power. The concern is the priority and the motive underpinning the endeavours of those with power. The authors propose that it is important for both the ISSB and GRI to serve the interest of a broad range of actors, including those who are not likely to have a say in sustainability reporting standard setting. Practical implications: This paper contributes to sustainability reporting practice by putting forward a case for strengthening current sustainability reporting practices with appropriate changes to overcome some of the criticisms of the GRI. Social implications: The authors highlight that there is a much broader group of stakeholders who require sustainability information and that it is important that the sustainability reporting standards serve the information needs of all stakeholders and not just those of the dominant actors. However, the ISSB with its economic focus will inevitably focus on the concern of investors and market participants. Originality/value: The originality in this paper is the use of Bourdieu’s concept of field to theoretically highlight how a new standard setter may disrupt the sustainability standard-setting field and act as a distraction from efforts to address sustainability issues and concerns that the world faces."

It examines the intersection of accounting and tax for Māori entrepreneurs and their relational interactions with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)/state/Crown and accountants by considering the contextual factors of history, culture and society of Māori. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research was adopted using face-to-face in-depth interviews with 34 participants and reviewing government documents. The authors analyse the tax compliance practice by drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of field, capital and habitus to conceptualise the tax field as a site of struggle for power and control by the IRD, accountants and indigenous entrepreneurs. Findings: This study demonstrates how the tax field is structured as a game between tax reporting, taxpaying and monitoring functions. The position within the field is determined by the actor's access to the relevant capitals and habitus. It identifies how accounting, given its centrality to tax compliance, facilitates the power relations between the IRD, accountants and Māori entrepreneurs. The Eurocentric accounting-based tax reporting and the contextual factors illuminate how indigenous entrepreneurs are being dominated in the tax field. They experienced cultural dissonance with conflicting responsibilities when traversing the collectivistic indigenous and tax fields. Their collectivism involves sharing resources as they cherish whanaungatanga (relationship, kinship) and manaakitanga (kindness, generosity), which are at odds and are not valued in the tax field. Practical implications: It is an empirical illustration of the connection between accounting, tax and power for indigenous taxpayers and their relationship with the IRD/Crown and accountants. It has practical implications for developing and enhancing tax compliance in jurisdictions with indigenous taxpayers. Such an understanding is helpful for policymakers, government, business agencies and the accounting professions when assisting, empowering and educating indigenous groups regarding tax compliance. Originality/value: This paper responds to the call for accounting research with modern-day indigenous peoples rather than historical ones. The paper fills a gap in the accounting and tax literature by examining the tax compliance practice of indigenous small and medium enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs using Bourdieu's framework. It identifies how the role of accounting creates, maintains and reinforces power structures in the tax field. Tax/accounting reporting based on Eurocentric rules disempowers and alienates indigenous entrepreneurs. They misrecognise their actions in reproducing the existing power structures in the tax field due to deeply held historical and cultural factors about the fear of the Crown/state and their practice of rangitaratanga (esteeming authorities)."

Design/methodology/approach: Empirical materials were collected as part of a qualitative field study with an Indigenous organization. Specific methods include interviews, informal conversations, documentary reviews and participant observations. These materials were analysed through a Bourdieusian perspective. Findings: By working with Indigenous Peoples on the ground, rather than relying on secondary materials, this study highlights how the values of a community challenge and reorient accounting practice towards community aspirations. This study illustrates how fields beyond the organization influence accounting practice, including in budgeting and assurance. Originality/value: Exploring Indigenous practices of accounting maintains Indigenous agency and opens up space for alternative understandings and practices of accounting.

We are motivated by emerging arguments around the importance for Indigenous practices and perspectives in governance, but without the proper resourcing to do so, Indigenous peoples rely on limited capacity and immeasurable amounts of unpaid labour. We thus explore how a colonial authority has resourced its authority, and erased Indigenous sovereignty, while exploring opportunities to resource Indigenous self-determination. This study merely scratches the surface of possibilities by mapping and mirroring sources of revenue generated by the Government of New Zealand and imagining how this revenue can either be shared through various means (incremental opportunities) or how Indigenous authorities can resource themselves through alternative means (progressive opportunities).

Particles influencing conductivity cells can also be small ice crystals (frazil) that may form in supercooled water. The detection of supercooled water depends on accurate, high precision temperature, salinity and pressure measurements. As it is currently not possible to measure salinity in situ, the standard procedure is to measure conductance over a known volume and calculate salinity. Frazil ice entrained into a conductivity cell changes the volume of conductive fluid in the conductivity cell, thus changing the conductivity, salinity and supercooling measurements. We present results on the effect of entraining microplastic into a Sea-Bird Electronics conductivity cell to simulate the effect of frazil. We show that particle volumes comparable to frazil volumes observed in the ocean change the measured conductivity and led to changes in calculated supercooling between 0.3 and 10 mK, possibly up to the same order of magnitude as naturally observed supercooling in the ocean. Further, we demonstrate that where supercooling is present, natural frazil ice concentrations can have an appreciable effect on parameters calculated with both the Equation of State of Seawater 1980 and Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 equations of state of seawater. Thus, to ensure accurate measurements in locations of very high frazil concentration, the entrainment of frazil needs to be prevented, which is not possible with methods currently available, or corrected for. An example for such a correction is given and could be modified to be applicable to other particles, for example, sediment."

We discuss three inter-related cases of temperature modelling — in phase transitions, thermal boundary resistance and slip flows — and show that the continuum view is fallacious on the ground that the microscopic details of a physical system are not necessarily decoupled from continuum models. We show how temperature discontinuities are present in both data (experiments and simulations) and phenomena (theory and models) and how discontinuum models of temperature variation may have greater empirical adequacy and explanatory power. The conclusions of our paper are: a) continuum idealisations are not indispensable to modelling physical phenomena and both continuous and discontinuous representations of phenomena work depending on the context; b) temperature is not necessarily a continuously defined function in our best scientific representations of the world; and c) that its continuity, where applicable, is a contingent matter.

However, although several soil spectral laboratories have been established worldwide, the distinct characteristics of instruments and operations still hamper further integration and interoperability across mid-infrared (MIR) soil spectral libraries. In this study, we conducted a large-scale ring trial experiment to understand the lab-to-lab variability of multiple MIR instruments. By developing a systematic evaluation of different mathematical treatments with modeling algorithms, including regular preprocessing and spectral standardization, we quantified and evaluated instruments' dissimilarity and how this impacts internal and shared model performance. We found that all instruments delivered good predictions when calibrated internally using the same instruments' characteristics and standard operating procedures by solely relying on regular spectral preprocessing that accounts for light scattering and multiplicative/additive effects, e.g., using standard normal variate (SNV). When performing model transfer from a large public library (the USDA NSSC-KSSL MIR library) to secondary instruments, good performance was also achieved by regular preprocessing (e.g., SNV) if both instruments shared the same manufacturer. However, significant differences between the KSSL MIR library and contrasting ring trial instruments responses were evident and confirmed by a semi-unsupervised spectral clustering. For heavily contrasting setups, spectral standardization was necessary before transferring prediction models. Non-linear model types like Cubist and memory-based learning delivered more precise estimates because they seemed to be less sensitive to spectral variations than global partial least square regression. In summary, the results from this study can assist new laboratories in building spectroscopy capacity utilizing existing MIR spectral libraries and support the recent global efforts to make soil spectroscopy universally accessible with centralized or shared operating procedures."

Soil spectral libraries (SSLs) have been developed across the world to calibrate prediction models for rapid and non-destructive assessment of soils at local, regional, national and global scales. Several continental or national libraries exist, for example, vis-NIR SSL in Europe, Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, China and Brazil, and MIR SSL in the U.S., Switzerland and Brazil. In this study, we document the development of a vis-NIR and MIR SSL of New Zealand based on legacy and modern samples that have been sieved to 2 mm and air-dried, and explore the application of such libraries for predicting a wide range of soil properties, including soil carbon (total carbon or organic carbon), total nitrogen, pH, soil texture (sand, silt and clay), phosphate retention and available water capacity (field capacity and permanent wilting point). The vis-NIR and MIR spectral features were compared between New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC) soil orders and the performances of both vis-NIR and MIR SSLs were compared with other national SSLs. Results of the study indicate that both vis-NIR and MIR SSL demonstrated reliable modelling performance using the PLSR model. However, MIR outperforms vis-NIR for all soil attributes. Furthermore, the study found that both vis-NIR and MIR have the potential to distinguish different soil orders within the NZSC."

In this study, we used a large amount of hand-feel soil texture (HFST) data to assess the performance of various published DSM products on the prediction of soil particle size distribution in Central France. We tested four DSM products for soil texture prediction developed at various scales (global, continental, national, and regional) by comparing their predictions with approximately 3 200 HFST observations realized on a 1:50 000 soil survey conducted after release of these DSM products. We used both visual comparisons and quantitative indicators to match the DSM predictions and HFST observations. The comparison between the low-cost HFST observations and DSM predictions clearly showed the applicability of various DSM products, with the prediction accuracy increasing from global to regional predictions. This simple evaluation can determine which products can be used at the local scale and if more accurate DSM products are required."

This study compared nutrient and sediment losses in surface runoff when cattle were fed winter hay supplement on two hill country sub-catchments (∼0.3 ha) with contrasting soil types (imperfectly-drained and well-drained soils). Runoff samples were collected during seven events (June-August). During this period, two herds of 16 pregnant, mixed aged Angus cows were supplemented with 2 kg DM. cow day−1 of hay in a defined feeding area within each sub-catchment. The imperfectly-drained soil measured 4.8 times the volume of surface runoff compared to the well-drained soil. As a result, the imperfectly-drained soil lost 2.5 times the amount of sediment, 6.3 and 5.1 times the amount of total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus respectively and 4.5 times the amount of total nitrogen (TN). Surface runoff losses of nitrate-N from the well-drained soil were undetectable over the study period. Whilst overall nutrient losses were low over the short study period (0.22 kg TP ha−1 and 0.68 kg TN ha−1), the results highlight the potential benefit of strategically placing cattle feed supplements on soils less prone to surface runoff to improve freshwater outcomes."

We predicted that increased head capsule size in male wē tā would hinder their foraging efficacy.

Eradication is often a default conservation management strategy even when it may not be feasible for a variety of reasons. Assessment of the substantive socioeconomic and ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS), both negative and positive, is increasingly viewed as an important step in management. We argue that one solution to IAS management is to align models of alien species management with Indigenous management frameworks that are relational and biocultural. We make the theoretical case that centring Indigenous management frameworks promises to strengthen overall management responses and outcomes because they attend directly to human and environmental justice concerns. We unpack the origins of the ‘introduced species paradigm’ to understand how binary framing of so-called ‘aliens’ and ‘natives’ recalls harmful histories and alienates Indigenous stewardship. Such a paradigm thereby may limit application of Indigenous frameworks and management, and impede long-term biodiversity protection solutions. We highlight how biocultural practices applied by Indigenous Peoples to IAS centre protecting relationships, fulfilling responsibilities and realising justice. Finally, we argue for a pluralistic vision that acknowledges multiple alternative Indigenous relationships and responses to introduced and IAS which can contribute to vibrant futures where all elements of society, including kin in the natural world, are able to flourish.

Although technology cannot substitute for real-life connection of youth to the environment, it can enable nature connectedness, a key factor in reclaiming cultural identity which is intrinsically embedded in nature for Indigenous Māori people. We explore Indigitization as a mechanism for transferring Indigenous ecological knowledge (mātauranga) through digital platforms: virtual reality (VR), and graphic novel (GN) in Māori and English. We used these technologies to capture the pūrākau (story) of a sacred area for Te Rarawa iwi (tribe) in New Zealand, to transfer Indigenous ecological knowledge (mātauranga) about Au Warawara Forest to youth. We assessed the impact of these digital resources on 122 students from Te Rarawa, from both local schools and the wider North Island, who attended a culturally based environmental program. The aim was to increase student levels of mātauranga in ecology. We surveyed students before and after exposure to VR and GN. Students responded positively to the VR, but student enthusiasm for both resources was high. After these experiences, students reported deeper connections to their history and the environment, and with increased awareness of mātauranga. More than half of the youth preferred experiencing VR and GN in Māori. These results show that Indigenous narratives conveyed through digital media support the transfer of ecological mātauranga Māori. Use of technologies such as VR and GN are likely to be critical for future biodiversity conservation sustainability through reconnection of Indigenous youth to cultural and ecological knowledges."

Reciprocity and the sharing of an intergenerational way of life in extended family collectives is an enduring cultural obligation. For many communities, hosting large gatherings expresses customary philosophies and practices and brings families together, and food and food systems are central to these events. We partnered with two Indigenous Māori communities in Aotearoa New Zealand to explore how these communities embody resilience in their food systems. We collected data from two large pan-community gatherings or poukai in the Waikato-Tainui tribal calendar that have been held annually for more than 100 years. The first took place in a remote, rural, coastal community, Marokopa, whereas the second took place at a tribal hub, Tūrangawaewae, that frequently hosts international visitors. Most visitors were > 50 years old, consistent with the purpose of this gathering, with more women elders than men attending. At Marokopa, volunteers returned from a variety of locations, mostly by car, in contrast to Tūrangawaewae where volunteers generally lived close and either walked or drove short distances to the poukai. Gifted contributions of food and supplies from local gardens continued a history of reciprocity and connection to traditional food systems at Marokopa. At Tūrangawaewae, most provisions were store bought, but there was a strong focus on healthy eating. Both events produced little waste. Despite a shift from traditional foods and self-sufficiency in food systems, these communities demonstrate collective resilience in their motivations for hosting, cultural vitality in their expressions of manaakitanga (hosting), and a commitment to kaitiakaitanga (stewardship) in their focus on healthy foods, recycling, food waste, and intergenerational learning at these events."

In New Zealand, alpine and subalpine ecosystems have been extensively modified through farming since 19th-century European settlement, with consequences for indigenous species such as the kea Nestor notabilis. We investigated feather stable isotope values in the kea and predicted a lower trophic position in modern kea populations, to reflect reduced lowland habitat and a mixed diet with more plant material. We predicted that size and sex would influence trophic values in this sexually dimorphic species, with larger birds more likely to have a high protein diet. We examined potential dietary changes in 68 museum collected kea from 1880s to 2000s, first recording accession details including provenance and sex and measuring culmen length. We used bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses (BSIAs) of feathers and a further feather subset using compound-specific stable isotope analyses of amino acids (CSIA-AA) to obtain isotopic values and estimate trophic position. BSIA showed δ15N values in kea feathers declined through time and could indicate that early century kea were highly omnivorous, with δ15N values on average higher than in modern kea. Variance in δ15N values was greater after 1950, driven by a few individuals. Few differences between males and females were evident, although females in the south region had lower δ15N values. There was a tendency for large male birds to have higher trophic values, perhaps reflecting dominant male bird behaviour noted in historical records. Nonetheless, CSIA-AA performed on a subset of the data suggested that variation in BSIA is likely due to baseline changes rather than relative trophic position which may be more homogenous than these data indicate. Although there was more variability in modern kea, we suggest caution in interpretation. Stable isotope data, particularly CSIA-AA, from museum specimens can reveal potential change in ecological networks as well as sexually dimorphic feeding patterns within species. The data can reveal temporal and regional variation in species trophic position and changes in ecosystem integrity to inform conservation decision-making."

Predator avoidance behaviours are one such area, and where there are colour morphs in New Zealand native and threatened insects, potential differences in the behaviour of these morphs can often be under investigated. The mountain stone wētā (Hemideina maori) possesses two distinct colour morphs, melanic and yellow, though the reason for this distinction is unclear. This study uses laboratory based assays to compare the behaviour of the morphs, including activity, refuge seeking, cohabitation, emergence and defensive behaviour. We observed emergence and cohabitation regularly, used video recordings to assay activity and refuge seeking behaviours, and measured defensive behaviours by probing individuals until a defensive response was displayed. Differences in all tested behaviours between colour morphs were non-significant; however, there were significant differences in defensive behaviour between sexes. We also discuss how defensive behaviours of H. maori compare with another tree wētā. Overall, the colour morphs in H. maori are similar in their predator responses and there may be a driving factor for melanism other than predation pressure. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D54E864D-844F-4619-84E6-44BBAC1DE4E5."

These responses may become ineffective, however, when a species is introduced to a novel predator type. When individuals cannot recognise an introduced predator for instance, they may respond in ways that mean they fail to avoid, escape, or neutralize a predator encounter. New Zealand's endemic insect fauna evolved in the absence of terrestrial mammalian predators for millions of years, resulting in the evolution of unique fauna like the large, flightless Orthopteran, the wētā. Here we investigate how experience with introduced mammalian predators might influence anti-predator behaviours by comparing behaviours in a group of Wellington tree wētā (Hemideina crassidens) living in an ecosanctuary, Zealandia, protected from non-native mammalian predators, and a group living in adjacent sites without mammalian predator control. We used behavioural phenotyping assays with both groups to examine rates of activity and defensive aggression shortly after capture, and again after a period of acclimation. We found that wētā living in protected areas were more active shortly after capture than wētā in non-protected habitats where mammalian predators were present. Male wētā living in non-protected areas tended to be less aggressive than any other group. These results suggest that lifetime experience with differing predator arrays may influence the expression of antipredator behaviour in tree wētā. Disentangling innate and experiential drivers of these behavioural responses further will have important implications for insect populations in rapidly changing environments."

In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for non-independence are rare. When studies do control for non-independence, our simulations suggest that most commonly used methods are insufficient for reducing false positives in non-independent data. In reanalyses of twelve previous cross-national correlations, half of the estimates are compatible with no association after controlling for non-independence using global proximity matrices.

As predicted, we find that cooperative behaviour is negatively related to SDO and economically conservative policy views, while conformist behaviour in the form of social information use is positively related to RWA and socially conservative policy views. However, we did not find the predicted relationships between punitive and rule following behaviours and RWA or socially conservative views, raising questions about the interpretation of punishment and rule following tasks and the nature of authoritarian conformist preferences. These findings reveal how cooperative and conformist preferences that evolved to help us navigate social challenges in our ancestral past continue to track our political differences even today."

We test predictions derived from this theory in a UK sample using individuals' responses to COVID-19 and widely-used measures of the two dimensions - 'right-wing authoritarianism' (RWA) and 'social dominance orientation' (SDO), respectively. Consistent with our predictions, we show that RWA, but not SDO, increased following the pandemic and that high-RWA conservatives do display more concerned, conformist, pro-lockdown attitudes, while high-SDO conservatives display less empathic, cooperative attitudes and are anti-lockdown.

For example, dance songs tend to be loud and rhythmic, and lullabies tend to be quiet and melodious. Human perceptual sensitivity to the behavioral contexts of songs, based on these musical features, suggests that basic properties of music are mutually intelligible, independent of linguistic or cultural content. Whether these effects reflect universal interpretations of vocal music, however, is unclear because prior studies focus almost exclusively on English-speaking participants, a group that is not representative of humans. Here, we report shared intuitions concerning the behavioral contexts of unfamiliar songs produced in unfamiliar languages, in participants living in Internet-connected industrialized societies (n = 5,516 native speakers of 28 languages) or smaller-scale societies with limited access to global media (n = 116 native speakers of three non-English languages). Participants listened to songs randomly selected from a representative sample of human vocal music, originally used in four behavioral contexts, and rated the degree to which they believed the song was used for each context. Listeners in both industrialized and smaller-scale societies inferred the contexts of dance songs, lullabies, and healing songs, but not love songs. Within and across cohorts, inferences were mutually consistent. Further, increased linguistic or geographical proximity between listeners and singers only minimally increased the accuracy of the inferences. These results demonstrate that the behavioral contexts of three common forms of music are mutually intelligible cross-culturally and imply that musical diversity, shaped by cultural evolution, is nonetheless grounded in some universal perceptual phenomena."

Existing scales used to measure political values, however, were created prior to this framework. Here, we introduce the Dual Foundations Scale, designed to capture values about the two trade-offs. We validate the scale across two studies, showing it accurately and reliably measures both dimensions. Our results support key predictions of the dual foundations framework and pave the way for future work on the foundations of political ideology."

We show that humans exhibit lower reproductive skew (i.e., inequality in the number of surviving offspring) among males and smaller sex differences in reproductive skew than most other mammals, while nevertheless falling within the mammalian range. Additionally, female reproductive skew is higher in polygynous human populations than in polygynous nonhumans mammals on average. This patterning of skew can be attributed in part to the prevalence of monogamy in humans compared to the predominance of polygyny in nonhuman mammals, to the limited degree of polygyny in the human societies that practice it, and to the importance of unequally held rival resources to women's fitness. The muted reproductive inequality observed in humans appears to be linked to several unusual characteristics of our species-including high levels of cooperation among males, high dependence on unequally held rival resources, complementarities between maternal and paternal investment, as well as social and legal institutions that enforce monogamous norms."

To evaluate these criteria, we examine the content of freely-listed data about gods’ concerns collected from individuals across eight diverse field sites and contextualize these beliefs in their respective cultural milieus. In our analysis, we find that local deities’ concerns point to costly threats to local coordination and cooperation. We conclude with a discussion of how alternative approaches to religious beliefs and appeals fare in light of our results and close by considering some key implications for the cognitive and evolutionary sciences of religion."

In late 2021, high vaccine coverage enabled the country to transition away from the elimination strategy to a mitigation strategy. However, given negligible levels of immunity from prior infection, this required careful planning and an effective public health response to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and unmanageable health impacts. Here, we develop an age-structured model for the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 including the effects of vaccination, case isolation, contact tracing, border controls and population-wide control measures. We use this model to investigate how epidemic trajectories may respond to different control strategies, and to explore trade-offs between restrictions in the community and restrictions at the border. We find that a low case tolerance strategy, with a quick change to stricter public health measures in response to increasing cases, reduced the health burden by a factor of three relative to a high tolerance strategy, but almost tripled the time spent in national lockdowns. Increasing the number of border arrivals was found to have a negligible effect on health burden once high vaccination rates were achieved and community transmission was widespread."

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for detecting recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reverse transcription PCR sensitivity varies over the course of an individual’s infection, related to changes in viral load. Differences in testing methods, and individual-level variables such as age, may also affect sensitivity. Methods. Using data from New Zealand, we estimate the time-varying sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR under varying temporal, biological, and demographic factors. Results. Sensitivity peaks 4–5 days postinfection at 92.7% (91.4%–94.0%) and remains over 88% between 5 and 14 days postinfection. After the peak, sensitivity declined more rapidly in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated, females compared with males, those aged under 40 compared with over 40s, and Pacific peoples compared with other ethnicities. Conclusions. Reverse transcription PCR remains a sensitive technique and has been an effective tool in New Zealand’s border and postborder measures to control coronavirus disease 2019.

These local changes and their impact on coastal hazards matter to coastal communities. NZ SeaRise produced relative sea level projections for Aotearoa to include the latest global climate and Antarctic Ice Sheet research and estimates of vertical land movement at high spatial resolution. Research-informed communication to the public and planners included a web-based projections tool supplemented by written and visual narratives, and a media engagement plan. This communication, and analysis of media impact, provided a case study for audience-relevant information on sea-level rise. Information regarding shoreline change and evolving hazards, required for risk assessment, was not included in the NZ SeaRise projections. New research is needed to reduce uncertainty in future Antarctic Ice Sheet contribution to sea level, link changes in sea surface height to our dynamic land surface and enhance communication approaches. Several examples of the required research are presented here but ongoing efforts must refine the timing and magnitude of coastline change, better define coastal hazards and risks, and develop appropriate adaptation strategies for unavoidable climate change impacts."

We explore the utility of routinely collected data in developing a tool to aid early identification of those at risk. Method: We used electronic health records of 4610 young people aged 5–19 years who were treated by Child and Youth Mental Health Services (CYMHS) in greater Brisbane, Australia. Two Lasso models were trained to predict the risk of future SHoSI in young people currently rated SHoSI; and those who were not. Results: For currently non-SHoSI children, an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC) of 0.78 was achieved. Those with the highest risk were 4.97 (CI 4.35–5.66) times more likely to be categorized as SHoSI in the future. For current SHoSI children, the AUC was 0.62. Conclusion: A prediction model with fair overall predictive power for currently non-SHoSI children was generated. Predicting persistence for SHoSI was more difficult. The electronic health records alone were not sufficient to discriminate at acceptable levels and may require adding unstructured data such as clinical notes. To optimally predict SHoSI models need to be tested and validated separately for those young people with varying degrees of risk."

We developed a machine learning model to predict poor school outcomes in children surviving intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Population-based study of children < 16 years requiring ICU admission in Queensland, Australia, between 1997 and 2019. Failure to meet the National Minimum Standard (NMS) in the National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) assessment during primary and secondary school was the primary outcome. Routine ICU information was used to train machine learning classifiers. Models were trained, validated and tested using stratified nested cross-validation. Results: 13,957 childhood ICU survivors with 37,200 corresponding NAPLAN tests after a median follow-up duration of 6 years were included. 14.7%, 17%, 15.6% and 16.6% failed to meet NMS in school grades 3, 5, 7 and 9. The model demonstrated an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8 (standard deviation SD, 0.01), with 51% specificity to reach 85% sensitivity [relative Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (rel-AUPRC) 3.42, SD 0.06]. Socio-economic status, illness severity, and neurological, congenital, and genetic disorders contributed most to the predictions. In children with no comorbidities admitted between 2009 and 2019, the model achieved a AUROC of 0.77 (SD 0.03) and a rel-AUPRC of 3.31 (SD 0.42). Conclusions: A machine learning model using data available at time of ICU discharge predicted failure to meet minimum educational requirements at school age. Implementation of this prediction tool could assist in prioritizing patients for follow-up and targeting of rehabilitative measures."

The retreat provided space for rest and rejuvenation as well as the opportunity to build connections and community. We found that giving participants space for deep thinking and sustained writing meant that they made significant progress on their research in the three and a half days of the retreats; they also reported increased well-being and a sense of feeling ‘cared for’ by their workplace. Although writing retreats don’t address the pervasive structural inequalities that structure the academy, they interrupt the exhausting scripts of everyday life with the gift of time in the context of care and connection."

Yet hazards from future tsunamis are difficult to quantify due to their rarity in the instrumental record. Statistical earthquake catalogs have previously been used to quantify tsunami hazards. For the first time, we use a physics-based synthetic earthquake catalog to assess probabilistic tsunami hazard in a local region. We analyze a 30,000-year catalog to capture a wide range of the source complexity evident in tsunamigenic earthquakes. We produce models of land-surface displacements and subsequent tsunamis from 2,585 earthquakes with magnitude > MW 7.0. Modeled slip of the Hikurangi and Tonga-Kermadec subduction thrusts generated maximum wave heights at the coast of up to 28 m and these earthquakes pose the greatest tsunami hazard along New Zealand's coastline. The results provide a “proof of concept” for using earthquake simulators for probabilistic tsunami hazard models. They further present a platform upon which next-generation probabilistic tsunami inundation models may be constructed."

In late 2021, high vaccine coverage enabled the country to transition away from the elimination strategy to a mitigation strategy. However, given negligible levels of immunity from prior infection, this required careful planning and an effective public health response to avoid uncontrolled outbreaks and unmanageable health impacts. Here, we develop an age-structured model for the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 including the effects of vaccination, case isolation, contact tracing, border controls and population-wide control measures. We use this model to investigate how epidemic trajectories may respond to different control strategies, and to explore trade-offs between restrictions in the community and restrictions at the border. We find that a low case tolerance strategy, with a quick change to stricter public health measures in response to increasing cases, reduced the health burden by a factor of three relative to a high tolerance strategy, but almost tripled the time spent in national lockdowns. Increasing the number of border arrivals was found to have a negligible effect on health burden once high vaccination rates were achieved and community transmission was widespread."

First, we collated 171 threats and opportunities across our diverse fields of research. We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for detecting recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reverse transcription PCR sensitivity varies over the course of an individual’s infection, related to changes in viral load. Differences in testing methods, and individual-level variables such as age, may also affect sensitivity. Methods. Using data from New Zealand, we estimate the time-varying sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR under varying temporal, biological, and demographic factors. Results. Sensitivity peaks 4–5 days postinfection at 92.7% (91.4%–94.0%) and remains over 88% between 5 and 14 days postinfection. After the peak, sensitivity declined more rapidly in vaccinated cases compared with unvaccinated, females compared with males, those aged under 40 compared with over 40s, and Pacific peoples compared with other ethnicities. Conclusions. Reverse transcription PCR remains a sensitive technique and has been an effective tool in New Zealand’s border and postborder measures to control coronavirus disease 2019. Our results inform model parameters and decisions concerning routine testing frequency."

This study aimed to objectively assess medication adherence by measuring carvedilol and enalaprilat plasma concentrations among patients with HF. Methods: The present sub-study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, helped by NT-proBNP testing, of Heart Failure therapies (STRONG-HF) study involved adult patients with acute HF admitted in two Mozambican and two Nigerian hospitals who were not optimally treated with oral enalapril and carvedilol. Patients in the high-intensity arm of the STRONG-HF study, and those not meeting the biomarker criteria for persistent congestion, were included in the “frequent visit” (FV) arm. In the FV arm, blood for bioanalysis of plasma enalaprilat or/and carvedilol was drawn at the 2,6,12th week post-discharge. Patients in the usual care arm of STRONG-HF were included in the “standard visit” (SV) arm, which followed the usual local practice with blood sampling in week 12. Results: The study involved 113 (79 FV and 34 SV) participants with a mean age of 48.6 years and a mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 33.1%. Theenalaprilat below the lower level of quantification (LLOQ) was documented in 7.7%, 11.9%, and 15.6% of participants in FV during the 2,6 and 12th weeks. Carvedilol concentration below LLOQ was documented in 37%, 30%, and 44.4% of participants in the FV arm during the 2,6 and 12th weeks, respectively. For the SV arm, enalaprilat and carvedilol concentrations below LLOQ in the twelfth week were documented in 37.3% and 42.9% of patients, respectively. Conclusion: Up to a third of patients using enalapril and carvedilol did not take any medication during the 12 weeks of follow-up. Non adherence was more common in patients who had less follow up, emphasizing the importance of close follow up to adherence. No adherence was also more common in medications know to have more side effects such as carvedilol."

Their long-term prognostic impact is less well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Via the National Echo Database of Australia (2000–2019), we identified normal wall motion versus WMA for each left ventricular wall among 492 338 individuals aged 61.9±17.9 years. The wall motion score index was also calculated. We then examined actual 1-and 5-year mortality, plus adjusted risk of long-term mortality according to WMA status. Overall, 39 346/255 697 men (15.4%) and 17 834/236 641 women (7.5%) had a WMA. The likelihood of a WMA was associated with increasing age and greater systolic/diastolic dysfunction. A defect in the inferior versus anterior wall was the most and least common WMA in men (8.0% and 2.5%) and women (3.3% and 1.1%), respectively. Any WMA increased 5-year mortality from 17.5% to 29.7% in men and from 14.9% to 30.8% in women. Known myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80–0.93]) or revascularization (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82–0.92]) was independently associated with a better prognosis, whereas men (1.22-fold increase) and those with greater systolic/diastolic dysfunction had a worse prognosis. Among those with any WMA, apical (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02–1.13]) or inferior (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04–1.15]) akinesis, dyskinesis or aneurysm, or a wall motion score index >3.0 conveyed the worst prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a large real-world clinical cohort, twice as many men as women have a WMA, with inferior WMA the most common. Any WMA confers a poor prognosis, especially inferoapical akinesis/dyskinesis/aneurysm."

We set out to investigate this potential association within an adult cohort who were born around the time of the Biafran War (1968–1970) and subsequent famine in Nigeria. This was a retrospective analysis of Abia State Non-Communicable Diseases and Cardiovascular Risk Factors (AS-NCD-CRF) Survey, a community-based, cross-sectional study that profiled 386 adults (47.4% men) of Igbo ethnicity born in the decade between January 1965 and December 1974. Based on their date of birth and the timing of the famine, participants were grouped according to their exposure to famine as children (Child-Fam) or in-utero fetus/infant (Fet-Inf-Fam) or no exposure (No-Fam). Binomial logit regression models were fitted to determine the association between famine exposure and hypertension in adulthood. Overall, 130 participants had hypertension (33.7%). Compared to the No-Fam group (24.4%), the prevalence of hypertension was significantly elevated in both the Child-Fam (43% - adjusted OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.14–5.36) and Fet-Inf-Fam (44.6% - adjusted OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.33–4.86) groups. The risk of hypertension in adulthood was highest among females within the Child-Fam group. However, within the Fet-Inf-Fam group males had a equivalently higher risk than females. These data suggest that early life exposure to famine and malnutrition in Africa is associated with a markedly increased risk of hypertension in adulthood; with sex-based differences evident. Thus, the importance of avoiding armed conflicts and food in-security in the region cannot be overstated.

Methods Adults (n=13 448) undergoing routine echocardiography without initial evidence of pulmonary hypertension (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, eRVSP <30.0 mmHg) or left heart disease were studied. Incident pulmonary hypertension (eRVSP ≥30.0 mmHg) was detected on repeat echocardiogram a median of 4.1 years apart. Mortality was examined according to increasing eRVSP levels (30.0–39.9, 40.0–49.9 and ≥50.0 mmHg) indicative of mild-to-severe pulmonary hypertension. Results A total of 6169 men (45.9%, aged 61.4±16.7 years) and 7279 women (60.8±16.9 years) without evidence of pulmonary hypertension were identified (first echocardiogram). Subsequently, 5412 (40.2%) developed evidence of pulmonary hypertension, comprising 4125 (30.7%), 928 (6.9%) and 359 (2.7%) cases with an eRVSP of 30.0–39.9 mmHg, 40.0–49.9 mmHg and ≥50.0 mmHg, respectively (incidence 94.0 and 90.9 cases per 1000 men and women, respectively, per year). Median (interquartile range) eRVSP increased by +0.0 (−2.27 to +2.67) mmHg and +30.68 (+26.03 to +37.31) mmHg among those with eRVSP <30.0 mmHg versus ≥50.0 mmHg. During a median 8.1 years of follow-up, 2776 (20.6%) died from all causes. Compared to those with eRVSP <30.0 mmHg, the adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was 1.30-fold higher in 30.0–39.9 mmHg, 1.82-fold higher in 40.0–49.9 mmHg and 2.11-fold higher in ≥50.0 mmHg groups (all p<0.001). Conclusions New-onset pulmonary hypertension, as indicated by elevated eRVSP, is a common finding among older patients without left heart disease followed-up with echocardiography. This phenomenon is associated with an increased morality risk even among those with mildly elevated eRVSP."

However, there is a paucity of data on the pattern of elevated blood pressure among adolescents aged 10–19 years in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to provide pooled estimates of high blood pressure prevalence and mean levels in adolescents aged 10–19 years across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, African Index Medicus, and Embase to identify studies published from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2021. To be included, primary studies had to be observational studies of adolescents aged 10–19 years residing in sub-Saharan African countries reporting the pooled prevalence of elevated blood pressure or with enough data to compute these estimates. We excluded studies on non-systemic hypertension, in African people not living in sub-Saharan Africa, with participant selection based on the presence of hypertension, and with adult cohorts in which we could not disaggregate data for adolescents. We independently extracted relevant data from individual studies using a standard data extraction form. We used a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of elevated blood pressure and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels overall and on a sex-specific basis. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022297948). Findings: We identified 2559 studies, and assessed 81 full-text studies for eligibility, of which 36 studies comprising 37 926 participants aged 10–19 years from ten (20%) of 49 sub-Saharan African countries were eligible. A pooled sample of 29 696 adolescents informed meta-analyses of elevated blood pressure and 27 155 adolescents informed meta-analyses of mean blood pressure. Sex data were available from 26 818 adolescents (14 369 [53·6%] were female and 12 449 [46·4%] were male) for the prevalence of elevated blood pressure and 23 777 adolescents (12 864 [54·1%] were female and 10 913 [45·9%] were male) for mean blood pressure. Study quality was high, with no low-quality studies. The reported prevalence of elevated blood pressure ranged from 4 (0·2%) of 1727 to 1755 (25·1%) of 6980 (pooled prevalence 9·9%, 95% CI 7·3–12·5; I?=99·2%, pheterogeneity<0·0001). Mean SBP was 111 mm Hg (95% CI 108–114) and mean DBP was 68 mm Hg (66–70). 13·4% (95% CI 12·9–13·9; pheterogeneity<0·0001) of male participants had elevated blood pressure compared with 11·9% (11·3–12·4; pheterogeneity<0·0001) of female participants (odds ratio 1·04, 95% CI 0·81–1·34; pheterogeneity<0·0001). Interpretation: To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the first systematic synthesis of blood pressure data specifically derived from adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Although many low-income countries were not represented in our study, our findings suggest that approximately one in ten adolescents have elevated blood pressure across sub-Saharan Africa. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to improve preventive heart-health programmes in the region. Funding: None."

Management of AF aims to reduce the risk of stroke, heart failure and premature mortality via rate or rhythm control. This study aimed to review the literature on the cost effectiveness of treatment strategies to manage AF among adults living in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (OvidSp), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EconLit and Google Scholar for relevant studies between September 2022 and November 2022. The search strategy involved medical subject headings or related text words. Data management and selection was performed using EndNote library. The titles and abstracts were screened followed by eligibility assessment of full texts. Selection, assessment of the risk of bias within the studies, and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. The cost-effectiveness results were synthesised narratively. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 365. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for each study was adjusted to 2021 USD values. Results: Fifty studies were included in the analysis after selection and risk of bias assessment. In high-income countries, apixaban was predominantly cost effective for stroke prevention in patients at low and moderate risk of stroke, while left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) was cost effective in patients at high risk of stroke. Propranolol was the cost-effective choice for rate control, while catheter ablation and the convergent procedure were cost-effective strategies in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Among the anti-arrhythmic drugs, sotalol was the cost-effective strategy for rhythm control. In middle-income countries, apixaban was the cost-effective choice for stroke prevention in patients at low and moderate risk of stroke while high-dose edoxaban was cost effective in patients at high risk of stroke. Radiofrequency catheter ablation was the cost-effective option in rhythm control. No data were available for low-income countries. Conclusion: This systematic review has shown that there are several cost-effective strategies to manage AF in different resource settings. However, the decision to use any strategy should be guided by objective clinical and economic evidence supported by sound clinical judgement. Registration: CRD42022360590."

Results The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for the AI-DSA to detect severe AS was 0.986 (95% CI 0.985 to 0.987) with 4622/88 199 (5.2%) individuals (79.0±11.9 years, 52.4% women) categorised as 'high-probability' severe AS. Of these, 3566 (77.2%) met guideline-defined severe AS. Compared with the AI-derived low-probability AS group (19.2% mortality), the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted OR for actual 5-year mortality was 2.41 (95% CI 2.13 to 2.73) in the high probability AS group (67.9% mortality)-5-year mortality being slightly higher in those with guideline-defined severe AS (69.1% vs 64.4%; age-adjusted and sex-adjusted OR 1.26 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.53), p=0.021). Conclusions An AI-DSA can identify the echocardiographic measurement characteristics of AS associated with poor survival (with not all cases guideline defined). Deployment of this tool in routine clinical practice could improve expedited identification of severe AS cases and more timely referral for therapy."

In a large cohort of adults with moderate or greater MR, we aimed to describe the prevalence and severity of PHT and assess its influence on outcomes. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed the National Echocardiography Database of Australia (data from 2000 to 2019). Adults with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (eRVSP), left ventricular ejection fraction >50% and with moderate or greater MR were included (n=9683). These subjects were then categorised according to their eRVSP. The relationship between PHT severity and mortality outcomes was evaluated (median follow-up of 3.2 years, IQR 1.3-6.2 years). Results Subjects were aged 76±12 years, and 62.6% (6038) were women. Overall, 959 (9.9%) had no PHT, and 2952 (30.5%), 3167 (32.7%), 1588 (16.4%) and 1017 (10.5%) patients had borderline, mild, moderate and severe PHT, respectively. A € typical left heart disease' phenotype was identified with worsening PHT, showing rising E:e′, right and left atrial sizes increasing progressively, from no PHT to severe PHT (p<0.0001, for all). With increasing PHT severity, 1- and 5-year actuarial mortality increased from 8.5% and 33.0% to 39.7% and 79.8%, respectively (p<0.0001). Similarly, adjusted survival analysis showed the risk of long-term mortality progressively increased with higher eRVSP levels (adjusted HR 1.20-2.86, borderline to severe PHT, p<0.0001 for all). A mortality inflection was apparent at an eRVSP level >34.00 mm Hg (HR 1.27, CI 1.00-1.36). Conclusions In this large study, we report on the importance of PHT in patients with MR. Mortality increases as PHT becomes more severe from an eRVSP of 34 mm Hg onwards."

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of symptoms, comorbidities, and cardiac damage in moderate and severe AS. Methods: A total of 846,198 echocardiographic investigations from 330,940 individuals aged >18 years were selected for the most recent echocardiogram, moderate or severe AS (mean gradient 20.0-39.9 mm Hg, aortic valve peak gradient 3.0-3.9 m/s and aortic valve area >1.0 cm2; or ≥40.0 mm Hg, ≥4.0 m/s or ≤1.0 cm2, respectively), and a cardiologist consultation. Natural Language Processing was applied to letters to extract comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement were excluded. Results: 2,213 patients (0.7% overall, 32.8% females) had moderate and 3,416 (1.0%, 47.3% females) had severe AS. Comorbidities were common, including hypertension, (56.6% moderate AS, 53.1% severe AS, P = 0.01), coronary disease (46.0% and 46.8%, respectively, P = 0.58) and atrial fibrillation (29.6% and 34.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptoms were also common in both moderate (n = 915, 41.3%) and severe (n = 1,630, 47.7%) AS (P < 0.001). Comorbidities were more likely in symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). Dyspnea was more likely in severe AS, whereas angina and syncope were similar in moderate vs severe AS. In multivariable analysis, only dyspnea was associated with severe (vs moderate) AS (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.41-2.13, P < 0.001). In both adjusted and unadjusted models, the degree of cardiac damage did not relate to presence of any symptoms but was associated with AS severity. Conclusions: Dyspnea is common in both moderate and severe AS, is associated with comorbidities and is not related to the degree of cardiac damage. Symptom-guided management decisions in AS may need revision."

How risk related to comorbidities compares at individual and population levels is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the risk related to comorbidities, alone and in combination, both at individual and population levels. Methods and results: Using two clinical trials in HF – the Prospective comparison of ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor) with ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor) to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in HF trial (PARADIGM-HF) and the Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients with Heart Failure trials (ATMOSPHERE) – we identified the 10 most common comorbidities and examined 45 possible pairs. We calculated population attributable fractions (PAF) for all-cause death and relative excess risk due to interaction with Cox proportional hazard models. Of 15 066 patients in the study, 14 133 (93.7%) had at least one and 11 867 (78.8%) had at least two of the 10 most prevalent comorbidities. The greatest individual risk among pairs was associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–2.33) and anaemia (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.39–2.11). The combination of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension had the highest PAF (5.65%; 95% CI 3.66–7.61). Two pairs demonstrated significant synergistic interaction (atrial fibrillation with CKD and coronary artery disease, respectively) and one an antagonistic interaction (anaemia and obesity). Conclusions: In HF, the impact of multimorbidity differed at the individual patient and population level, depending on the prevalence of and the risk related to each comorbidity, and the interaction between individual comorbidities. Patients with coexistent PAD and stroke were at greatest individual risk whereas, from a population perspective, coexistent CKD and hypertension mattered most."

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Nurse-led Intervention for Less Chronic HF (NIL-CHF) study was a single-centre randomized trial of nurse-led prevention involving cardiac inpatients without HF. At 3 years, 454 survivors (aged 66 ± 11 years, 71% men and 68% coronary artery disease) had the following: (i) a normal echocardiogram (128 cases/28.2%), (ii) structural heart disease (196/43.2%), or (iii) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction/left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVDD/LVSD: 130/28.6%). Outcomes were examined during median 8.3 (interquartile range 7.8-8.8) years according to these hierarchal groups and change in cardiac status from baseline to 3 years. Overall, 109 (24.0%) participants had a de novo HF admission or died while accumulating 551 cardiovascular-related admissions/3643 days of hospital stay. Progressively worse cardiac status correlated with increased hospitalizations (P < 0.001). The mean rate (95% confidence interval) of cardiovascular admissions/days of hospital stay being 0.09 (0.05-0.12) admissions/0.33 (0.13-0.54) days vs. 0.27 (0.20-0.34) admissions/2.20 (1.36-3.04) days per annum for those with a normal echocardiogram vs. LVDD/LVSD at 3 years. With progressively higher event rates, the adjusted hazard ratio for a de novo HF admission and/or death associated with a structural abnormality (24.5% of cases) and LVDD/LVSD (36.2%) at 3 years was 1.57 (0.82-3.01; P = 0.173) and 2.07 (1.05-4.05; P = 0.035) compared with a normal echocardiogram (10.9%). Mortality also mirrored the direction/extent of cardiac status/trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the positive initial effects of NIL-CHF intervention on cardiac recovery contributed to better long-term outcomes among patients at high risk of HF. However, prevention of HF remains challenging."

Adjusted for clinical confounders, the risk associated with increasing AS severity across the spectrum of AS severity remains uncertain. Methods: The authors conducted an international, multicenter, parallel-cohort study of 217,599 Australian (mean age, 76.0 ± 7.3 years; 49.3% women) and 30,865 US (mean age, 77.4 ± 7.3 years; 52.2% women) patients aged ≥65 years who underwent echocardiography. Patients with previous aortic valve replacement were excluded. The risk of increasing AS severity, quantified by peak aortic velocity (Vmax), was assessed through linkage to 97,576 and 14,481 all-cause deaths in Australia and the United States, respectively. Results: The distribution of AS severity (mean Vmax, 1.7 ± 0.7 m/sec) was similar in both cohorts. Compared with those with Vmax of 1.0 to 1.49 m/sec, those with Vmax of 2.50 to 2.99 m/sec (US cohort) or Vmax of 3.0 to 3.49 m/sec (Australian cohort) had a 1.5-fold increase in mortality risk within 10 years, adjusting for age, sex, presence of left heart disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Overall, the adjusted risk for mortality plateaued (1.75- to 2.25-fold increased risk) above a Vmax of 3.5 m/sec. This pattern of mortality persisted despite adjustment for a comprehensive list of comorbidities and treatments within the US cohort. Conclusions: Within large, parallel patient cohorts managed in different health systems, similar patterns of mortality linked to increasingly severe AS were observed. These findings support ongoing clinical trials of aortic valve replacement in patients with nonsevere AS and suggest the need to develop and apply more proactive surveillance strategies in this high-risk population."

One way to identify transmission pairs – two hosts in which infection was transmitted from one to the other – is using the variation of the pathogen within each single host (within-host variation). However, the role of such variation in transmission is understudied due to a lack of experimental and clinical datasets that capture pathogen diversity in both donor and recipient hosts. In this work, we assess the utility of deep-sequenced genomic surveillance (where genomic regions are sequenced hundreds to thousands of times) using a mouse transmission model involving controlled spread of the pathogenic bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from infected to naïve female animals. We observe that within-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) are maintained over multiple transmission steps and present a model for inferring the likelihood that a given pair of sequenced samples are linked by transmission. In this work we show that, beyond the presence and absence of within-host variants, differences arising in the relative abundance of iSNVs (allelic frequency) can infer transmission pairs more precisely. Our approach further highlights the critical role bottlenecks play in reserving the within-host diversity during transmission."

Yet the ways in which these technologies have been applied to manage the pandemic are varied. Main text: Aotearoa New Zealand was one of a small number of countries to adopt an elimination strategy for COVID-19, establishing a managed isolation and quarantine system for all international arrivals. To aid our response, we rapidly set up and scaled our use of genomic technologies to help identify community cases of COVID-19, to understand how they had arisen, and to determine the appropriate action to maintain elimination. Once New Zealand pivoted from elimination to suppression in late 2021, our genomic response changed to focusing on identifying new variants arriving at the border, tracking their incidence around the country, and examining any links between specific variants and increased disease severity. Wastewater detection, quantitation and variant detection were also phased into the response. Here, we explore New Zealand’s genomic journey through the pandemic and provide a high-level overview of the lessons learned and potential future capabilities to better prepare for future pandemics. Conclusions: Our commentary is aimed at health professionals and decision-makers who might not be familiar with genetic technologies, how they can be used, and why this is an area with great potential to assist in disease detection and tracking now and in the future."

Reputational scoring can provide the necessary motivation via “indirect reciprocity, ” but maintaining reliable scores requires close oversight to prevent cheating. We show that in the absence of such supervision, it is possible that scores might be managed by mutual consent between the agents themselves instead of by third parties. The space of possible strategies for such “consented” score changes is very large but, using a simple cooperation game, we search it, asking what kinds of agreement can i) invade a population from rare and ii) resist invasion once common. We prove mathematically and demonstrate computationally that score mediation by mutual consent does enable cooperation without oversight. Moreover, the most invasive and stable strategies belong to one family and ground the concept of value by incrementing one score at the cost of the other, thus closely resembling the token exchange that underlies money in everyday human transactions. The most successful strategy has the flavor of money except that agents without money can generate new score if they meet. This strategy is evolutionarily stable, and has higher fitness, but is not physically realizable in a decentralized way; when conservation of score is enforced more money-like strategies dominate. The equilibrium distribution of scores under any of this family of strategies is geometric, meaning that agents with score 0 are inherent to money-like strategies."

Detection of such changepoints can be improved by accounting for the epidemic structure, but this is currently difficult if the background level is unknown. Furthermore, in practical data the background often undergoes nuisance changes, which interfere with standard estimation techniques and appear as false alarms. To solve these issues, we develop a new, efficient approach to simultaneously detect epidemic changes and estimate unknown, but fixed, background level, based on a penalised cost. Using it, we build a two-level detector that models and separates nuisance and signal changes. The analytic and computational properties of the proposed methods are established, including consistency and convergence. We demonstrate via simulations that our two-level detector provides accurate estimation of changepoints under a nuisance process, while other state-of-the-art detectors fail. In real-world genomic and demographic datasets, the proposed method identified and localised target events while separating out seasonal variations and experimental artefacts."

Flooding regime variability is a key driver of ecological dynamism in these systems, dictating primary productivity on a large spatial scale. The functional composition or diversity of wetland-dependent bird species has been found to be sensitive to fluctuations in hydrological regimes and can thus be indicative of cascading ecosystem responses associated with climate change. In this paper, we investigate whether large-scale changes in inundation and fire—a significant additional biodiversity determinant in (semi-)arid landscapes—are reliable predictors of functional group responses of wetland-dependent birds along a perennial channel of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We fit generalized additive models (GAMs) to 6 years of bird survey data collected along ~190-km-long annual transects and use remotely sensed landscape-level inundation estimates, as well as spatiotemporal distance to fire, to predict the responsiveness of seven trait-based functional group abundances. During the surveys, a total of 89 different wetland-dependent bird species were recorded, including 76 residents, across all years, with below-surface feeding waders consistently the most abundant functional group. Including estimated spatiotemporal variability in flooding and fire, as well as their interactions, improved model fit for all seven functional groups, explaining between 46.8% and 68.3% of variability in functional group abundances. Covariates representing longer-term variability in inundation generally performed better than shorter-term ones. For example, variability in inundation over the 5 months preceding a survey best predicted the responses of all functional groups, which also all exhibited responsiveness to the interaction between flooding and fire. We were able to interpret the responses of individual functional groups, based on the resource exploitation assumption. Overall, our results suggest that perennial waters in dryland wetlands offer functional refugia to wetland-dependent birds and highlight the indicative power of large-scale trait-based bird monitoring. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of such a monitoring regime for dryland wetland ecosystems vulnerable to industrial-scale anthropogenic pressure and associated climate change."

We leverage extensive long-term metadata to quantify genome-wide diversity of the species over time and present new approaches using probabilistic programming, combined with a phenotype dataset spanning five decades, to disentangle phenotypic variance into environmental and genetic effects while quantifying uncertainty in small populations. We find associations for growth, disease susceptibility, clutch size and egg fertility within genic regions previously shown to influence these traits in other species. Finally, we generate breeding values to predict phenotype and illustrate that active management over the past 45 years has maintained both genome-wide diversity and diversity in breeding values and, hence, evolutionary potential. We provide new pathways for informing future conservation management decisions for kākāpō, including prioritizing individuals for translocation and monitoring individuals with poor growth or high disease risk.

Animal conservation often requires intensive management actions to improve reproductive output, yet any adverse effects of these may not be immediately apparent, particularly in threatened species with small populations and long lifespans. Hand-rearing is an example of a conservation management strategy which, while boosting populations, can cause long-term demographic and behavioural problems. It is used in the recovery of the critically endangered kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus), a flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand, to improve the slow population growth that is due to infrequent breeding, low fertility and low hatching success. Methods. We applied Bayesian mixed models to examine whether hand-rearing and other factors were associated with clutch fertility in kākāpō. We used projection predictive variable selection to compare the relative contributions to fertility from the parents’ rearing environment, their age and previous copulation experience, the parental kinship, and the number of mates and copulations for each clutch. We also explored how the incidence of repeated copulations and multiple mates varied with kākāpō density. Results. The rearing status of the clutch father and the number of mates and copulations of the clutch mother were the dominant factors in predicting fertility. Clutches were less likely to be fertile if the father was hand-reared compared to wild-reared, but there was no similar effect for mothers. Clutches produced by females copulating with different males were more likely to be fertile than those from repeated copulations with one male, which in turn had a higher probability of fertility than those from a single copulation. The likelihood of multiple copulations and mates increased with female:male adult sex ratio, perhaps as a result of mate guarding by females. Parental kinship, copulation experience and age all had negligible associations with clutch fertility. Conclusions. These results provide a rare assessment of factors affecting fertility in a wild threatened bird species, with implications for conservation management. The increased fertility due to multiple mates and copulations, combined with the evidence for mate guarding and previous results of kākāpō sperm morphology, suggests that an evolutionary mechanism exists to optimise fertility through sperm competition in kākāpō. The high frequency of clutches produced from single copulations in the contemporary population may therefore represent an unnatural state, perhaps due to too few females. This suggests that opportunity for sperm competition should be maximised by increasing population densities, optimising sex ratios, and using artificial insemination. The lower fertility of hand-reared males may result from behavioural defects due to lack of exposure to conspecifics at critical development stages, as seen in other taxa. This potential negative impact of hand-rearing must be balanced against the short-term benefits it provides."

As an interdisciplinary team with diverse data management experience, we recognize the growing need for guidance on comprehensive data management practices that minimize the risks of data loss, maximize efficiency for stand-alone projects, enhance opportunities for data reuse, facilitate Indigenous data sovereignty and uphold the FAIR and CARE Guiding Principles. Here, we describe four fictional personas reflecting differing user experiences with data management to identify data management challenges across the biodiversity genomics research ecosystem. We then use these personas to demonstrate realistic considerations, compromises and actions for biodiversity genomic data management. We also launch the Biodiversity Genomics Data Management Hub (https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/), containing tips, tricks and resources to support biodiversity genomics researchers, especially those new to data management, in their journey towards best practice. The Hub also provides an opportunity for those biodiversity researchers whose expertise lies beyond genomics and are keen to advance their data management journey.

From a biodiversity genomics perspective, the characterization of genome-wide SVs provides an exciting opportunity to complement single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, little is known about the impacts of SV discovery and genotyping strategies on the characterization of genome-wide SV diversity within and among populations. Here, we explore a near whole-species resequence data set, and long-read sequence data for a subset of highly represented individuals in the critically endangered kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus). We demonstrate that even when using a highly contiguous reference genome, different discovery and genotyping strategies can significantly impact the type, size and location of SVs characterized genome-wide. Further, we found that the mean number of SVs in each of two kākāpō lineages differed both within and across generations. These combined results suggest that genome-wide characterization of SVs remains challenging at the population-scale. We are optimistic that increased accessibility to long-read sequencing and advancements in bioinformatic approaches including multireference approaches like genome graphs will alleviate at least some of the challenges associated with resolving SV characteristics below the species level. In the meantime, we address caveats, highlight considerations, and provide recommendations for the characterization of genome-wide SVs in biodiversity genomic research."

This colonial legacy reflects an intensive land use driven by a European commodities market that experienced a series of boom-and-bust cycles. Although arid and seemingly resource limited, colonial farmers in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries copied water capture techniques from the Indigenous population, were strategic in terms of field placement, and engaged in a range of niche construction techniques. An analysis of 420 soil samples for their chemical properties (e.g., pH, electrical conductivity, nutrients) has revealed that sixteenth to nineteenth agricultural infrastructure in the form of open fields, terraces, water capture basins, and mulched fields was constructed on the landscape avoiding areas of high soil salinity and placement was tailored to variations in terrain slope, elevation, and rainfall. These improvements fundamentally changed ecosystem relations resulting in increased agricultural productivity. A series of eolian and volcanic events in the eighteenth century resulted in environmental changes requiring counteractive responses and new processes of niche reconfiguration. Large tracts of land were initially removed from production, but processes of niche construction created new opportunities. These included constructing mulched pits for cultivating sweet potato and tephra mulching for enhanced moisture conservation and accelerated growth of cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus) production on cactus host plants. Cochineal production lasted for a period of sixty years (ca. AD 1825–1885) before a collapse of the market caused by the invention of chemical substitutes."

Fuzzy alpha-shapes are presented as a highly generic and adaptable methodology that can produce maps of spatial objects that recognise the vague and uncertain nature of many geographies.

In New Zealand, plantations of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) occupy c. 1.6 million ha and form 90% of planted forests. Although radiata pine has naturalized since 1904, there is a general view in New Zealand that this species has not invaded widely. We comprehensively review where radiata pine has invaded throughout New Zealand. We used a combination of observational data and climate niche modelling to reveal that invasion has occurred nationally. Climate niche modelling demonstrates that while current occurrences are patchy, up to 76% of the land area (i.e. 211,388 km2) is climatically capable of supporting populations. Radiata pine has mainly invaded grasslands and shrublands, but also some forests. Notably, it has invaded lower-statured vegetation, including three classes of naturally uncommon ecosystems, primary successions and secondary successions. Overall, our findings demonstrate pervasive and ongoing invasion of radiata pine outside plantations. The relatively high growth rates and per individual effects of radiata pine may result in strong effects on naturally uncommon ecosystems and may alter successional trajectories. Local and central government currently manage radiata pine invasions while propagule pressure from existing and new plantations grows, hence greater emphasis is warranted both on managing current invasions and proactively preventing future radiata pine invasions. We therefore recommend a levy on new non-native conifer plantations to offset costs of managing invasions, and stricter regulations to protect vulnerable ecosystems. A levy on economic uses of invasive species to offset costs of managing invasions alongside stricter regulations to protect vulnerable ecosystems could be a widely adopted measure to avert future negative impacts."

Reciprocity and the sharing of an intergenerational way of life in extended family collectives is an enduring cultural obligation. For many communities, hosting large gatherings expresses customary philosophies and practices and brings families together, and food and food systems are central to these events. We partnered with two Indigenous Māori communities in Aotearoa New Zealand to explore how these communities embody resilience in their food systems. We collected data from two large pan-community gatherings or poukai in the Waikato-Tainui tribal calendar that have been held annually for more than 100 years. The first took place in a remote, rural, coastal community, Marokopa, whereas the second took place at a tribal hub, Tūrangawaewae, that frequently hosts international visitors. Most visitors were > 50 years old, consistent with the purpose of this gathering, with more women elders than men attending. At Marokopa, volunteers returned from a variety of locations, mostly by car, in contrast to Tūrangawaewae where volunteers generally lived close and either walked or drove short distances to the poukai. Gifted contributions of food and supplies from local gardens continued a history of reciprocity and connection to traditional food systems at Marokopa. At Tūrangawaewae, most provisions were store bought, but there was a strong focus on healthy eating. Both events produced little waste. Despite a shift from traditional foods and self-sufficiency in food systems, these communities demonstrate collective resilience in their motivations for hosting, cultural vitality in their expressions of manaakitanga (hosting), and a commitment to kaitiakaitanga (stewardship) in their focus on healthy foods, recycling, food waste, and intergenerational learning at these events."

The RICE δ18O record is correlated with Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Pacific–South American pattern 1 (PSA1), which both project onto the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea (ABS) geopotential height field. Pacific sector Southern Ocean, eastern Ross Sea, and West Antarctic’s atmospheric circulation, sea ice, and surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies, as well as RICE δ18O, are strongest when El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and SAM are “in-phase”. That is when the SAM − /PSA1 + (El Niño) and SAM + /PSA1 − (La Niña) phasing prevails. When in-phase, the δ18O correlation with the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) is strong in regions (e.g., the Amundsen Sea) where their anomalies associated with SAM and PSA1 show the same sign. SAM − /PSA1 + (El Niño) and SAM + /PSA1 − (La Niña) is associated with positive and negative δ18O anomalies, respectively. RICE δ18O can aid in establishing past natural variability of the strength of the SH high-latitude Pacific sector ENSO-SAM connection and associated atmospheric circulation, sea ice, and SAT extremes."

We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

We also develop a general formalism of indicators for individual multipole densities that provide a physical interpretation and quantification of multipolar order. Our work clarifies the relation between patterns of localized multipoles and macroscopic multipole densities they give rise to.

The management of this pest using synthetic pesticides is problematic because of the development of pesticide resistance and environmental concerns including impacts on non-target organisms. The predatory bug Engytatus nicotianae has recently been identified as a useful biocontrol agent for TPP in greenhouses. The soil fungus Trichoderma Pers. is commonly used as a plant growth enhancer and biocontrol agent against phytopathogenic fungi. Therefore, there could be advantages associated with the combined use of these biocontrol agents. Some reports in other systems suggest that Trichoderma inoculation may alter the behaviour of pests and their natural enemies by modifying plant defence metabolites such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For this reason, this study aimed to investigate the individual and combined efficacy of these biocontrol agents (i.e., Trichoderma atroviride and E. nicotianae) against TPP in greenhouse grown tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Merlice). To this end, we compared the effect of each biocontrol agent and their combination on TPP abundance across different developmental stages (egg, nymphs, adults) and the number of infested leaves. We also investigated plant VOC emissions under the different treatments. Across all measured TPP stages, the treatments tested (E. nicotianae alone, T. atrovirdae alone, and T. atrovirdae + E. nicotianae) significantly reduced mean TPP counts relative to the control, and no significant differences were observed in VOC emissions among treatments. Overall, T. atrovirdae alone was less effective than E. nicotianae alone and its combination with T. atrovirdae in suppressing TPP populations. However, the combined use of Trichoderma + E. nicotianae did not show significant advantages over the use of E. nicotianae alone in controlling TPP. Therefore, their combined use needs to be further assessed in light of other advantages of Trichoderma to the crop (e.g., growth promotion or pathogen defence)."

The evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis (EICA) gives a possible answer for why some introduced plants become invasive by stating that they can escape natural coevolved enemies (pests, pathogens and herbivores) in their new environment, thus allowing them to shift resource allocation from producing expensive chemical defences, towards a higher growth rate and competitive ability. In order to test if there is evidence for increased competitive ability in introduced populations, we examined the performance of three Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) from their native (United Kingdom) and introduced ranges (New Zealand), when grown alone and in competition with a conspecific from the same or a different provenance. Based on the predictions of EICA, we hypothesised that plants from the introduced provenance would: (i) have a faster growth rate and a larger biomass at harvest; and (ii) would perform better in competition with a conspecific from the native provenance than one from the introduced provenance. Intraspecific competition reduced biomass by as much as 50%. However, contrary to expectations, we found no difference between the performance of plants from native and introduced provenances when grown in direct competition with each other. Plant performance when grown with a conspecific from the same provenance was similar to performance when paired with one from a different provenance, showing that there was no provenance effect. These results were consistent for all three Rumex species. Our findings contradict the predictions of the EICA hypothesis suggesting that other factors are needed to explain the success of Rumex species in New Zealand."

We investigate two likely sources of risk from harvesting aquatic wild foods. The first is water contact, and the second is contact with/ingestion of the harvest. We used E. coli as a proxy for microbial water quality at harvesting sites. Two popular mahinga kai species were also harvested and assessed. We found antibiotic-resistant bacteria on watercress (Nasturtium officinale) and cockles (Austrovenus stutchburyi). One-third of E. coli isolates were conjugative donors of at least one resistance phenotype. Tank experiments were used to track the internalization of E. coli by Greenshell/lip mussels (Perna canaliculus). Greenshell mussels kept at environmentally relevant concentrations of E. coli were colonized to levels considered unsafe for human consumption in 24 h. Finally, we measured horizontal gene transfer between bacteria within the shellfish, what we termed ‘intra-shellular’ conjugation.

This may result in reduced pressure to produce chemical defences that act against herbivores. We measured the most abundant secondary metabolites found in Rumex spp., namely oxalates, phenols and tannins. To test this hypothesis, we compared native (UK) and introduced (NZ) provenances of three different Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) to assess whether any significant differences existed in their levels of chemical defences in either leaves and roots. All three species have previously been shown to support a lower diversity of insect herbivores and experience less herbivory in the introduced range. We further examined leaf herbivory on plants from both provenances when grown together in a common garden experiment in New Zealand to test whether any differences in damage might be consistent with variation in the quantity of chemical defences. We found that two Rumex species (R. obtusifolius and R. crispus) showed no evidence for a reduction in chemical defences, while a third (R. conglomeratus) showed only limited evidence. The common garden experiment revealed that the leaves analysed had low levels of herbivory (~ 0.5%) with no differences in damage between provenances for any of the three study species. Roots tended to have a higher concentration of tannins than shoots, but again showed no difference between the provenances. As such, the findings of this study provide no evidence for lower plant investments in chemical defences, suggesting that other factors explain the success of Rumex spp. in New Zealand."

However, it is often unclear how to connect details of these interactions with complex modern analyses of biodiversity. To resolve this gap, we propose a unification of models of biotic interactions and measurements of diversity. We show that analyses of biodiversity obscure details about biotic interactions. For example, identical changes in biodiversity can arise from predation, competition or mutualism. Our approach indicates that traditional models of community assembly miss key facets of diversity change. Instead, we suggest that analyses of diversity change should focus on partitions, which measure mechanisms that directly shape changes in diversity, notably species level selection and immigration, rather than traditional analyses of biotic interactions."

We then scored each item for novelty and potential impact and finally reduced the list to ten threats and ten opportunities through a prioritisation process. Within the 20 items presented in this paper, we uncover a range of climate-related costs and benefits. Unexpected opportunities evolve from economic reorganisation and changes to perspectives. The threats we highlight include the overall failure to interconnect siloed policy responses, as well as those relating to extreme events and feedbacks, as well as pressures that undermine the coherence of society. A major theme of our work is that climate change effects in Aotearoa are likely to transgress the boundaries of research disciplines, industry sectors and policy systems, emphasising the importance of developing transdisciplinary methods and approaches. We use this insight to connect potential responses to climate change with Aotearoa’s culture and geography."

Climatic niche shifts are known to occur across a range of taxa, however we do not currently understand whether climatic niche shifts can consistently be predicted across multiple introduced ranges. Using three congeneric weed species, we investigate whether climatic niche shifts in one introduced range are consistent in other ranges where the species has been introduced. We compared the climatic conditions occupied by Rumex conglomeratus, R. crispus, and R. obtusifolius between their native range (Eurasia) and three different introduced ranges (North America, Australia, New Zealand). We considered metrics of niche overlap, expansion, unfilling, pioneering, and similarity to determine whether climatic niche shifts were consistent across ranges and congeners. We found that the presence and direction of climatic niche shifts was inconsistent between introduced ranges for each species. Within an introduced range, however, niche shifts were qualitatively similar among species. North America and New Zealand experienced diverging niche expansion into drier and wetter climates respectively, whilst the niche was conserved in Australia. This work highlights how unique characteristics of an introduced range and local introduction history can drive different niche shifts, and that comparisons between only the native and one introduced range may misrepresent a species’ capacity for niche shifts. However, predictions of climatic niche shifts could be improved by comparing related species in the introduced range rather than relying on the occupied environments of the native range."

It is expected that anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change and human activities will tend to create less energetically-efficient ecosystems that support less biomass per unit energy flow. It is debated, however, whether this expected development should translate into bottom-heavy (with small basal species being the most abundant) or top-heavy communities (where more biomass is supported at higher trophic levels with species having larger body sizes). Here, we combine ecological theory and empirical data to demonstrate that full marine protection promotes shifts towards top-heavy energetically-efficient structures in marine communities. First, we use metabolic scaling theory to show that protected communities are expected to display stronger top-heavy structures than disturbed communities. Similarly, we show theoretically that communities with high energy transfer efficiency display stronger top-heavy structures than communities with low transfer efficiency. Next, we use empirical structures observed within fully protected marine areas compared to disturbed areas that vary in stress from thermal events and adjacent human activity. Using a nonparametric causal-inference analysis, we find a strong, positive, causal effect between full marine protection and stronger top-heavy structures. Our work corroborates ecological theory on community development and provides a quantitative framework to study the potential restorative effects of different candidate strategies on protected areas."

Associated flood protection measures that often follow intensification constrict the rivers' capacity to adjust to ever-changing flows of water and sediment. Despite the rivers' vulnerability and constriction, New Zealand law defines braided rivers in a way that limits local councils' authority to manage land use within the braidplain. This paper explores the relationship between the law and science of braided rivers, demonstrating how legislative reforms underway in 2023 express the ways in which particular social processes play out in the landscape."

Most dark-patterns research has been undertaken in the United States and Europe and by user experience or human computer interaction researchers. In this study, we adopt a media and communication studies and science and technology studies approach to investigate where dark patterns “cluster” in online environments. A walkthrough of the top 100 New Zealand websites leads us to the following findings: (1) dark patterns cluster around financial transactions; (2) the most common types of dark patterns constitute a form of interface interference; and (3) dark patterns are often deployed as mechanisms to drive revenue, facilitate customer surveillance, and reduce business operations costs, and appear to be largely imported from overseas markets."

Scholarship has largely assumed that designers are complicit in manipulating the user and undermining their privacy. In this paper, we investigate privacy dark patterns and report on interviews conducted with UX practitioners, describing three findings: (a) designers feel motivated to act ethically due to their “moral compasses”; (b) designers are restricted in their ability to act ethically due to commercial pressures and a limited purview of the project; (c) designers’ understanding of the ethics of their practice do not currently match determinations made by international privacy and design scholars and demonstrate a limited understanding of how user behavior can be shaped. We conclude by outlining the benefits of independent regulation and progressive ethics education in UX."

This can be largely attributed to their public role in the COVID-19 daily press briefings that featured the Prime Minister and other government officials speaking to the public and answering questions from Press Gallery journalists. The daily briefings were livestreamed directly to New Zealanders via television, radio and online media, with some journalists receiving heavy criticism by the public for asking ‘aggressive’ or ‘irresponsible’ questions. This paper explores the Press Gallery’s perception of their journalistic role during the March-May 2020 daily briefings. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with fourteen Press Gallery journalists, I find they perceived their journalistic roles at the daily briefings to be: 1) holding government decisions to account; 2) disseminating public information and educating audiences on public health issues and measures; 3) producing news or undertaking newsgathering practices. I discuss how the Press Gallery’s perceived role(s) placed them in tension with audiences and complicates existing scholarly understanding of journalistic roles."

The research system's complexity and longevity gives the impression of stability and fixity, but we argue it is characterised by a lack of imagination around leadership that generates change. In this article, we examine the embodied experiences of research leadership, as encountered by participants at Aotearoa New Zealand's universities and a nationally funded Centre of Research Excellence. It is within such institutions and organisations, built on colonial and patriarchal values, that experiences of marginalisation, oppression and harassment have been documented. We destabilise the apparently static nature of this ‘research system monolith’ by taking up MacLeavy, Fannin and Larner's (2021) provocation of a feminist approach to boldly do leadership differently. Drawing from interviews with researchers, we argue that resistance to, and reworking of, the research system can be found in feminist modes of practice: in the everyday, mundane practices of care-full research leadership that do leadership differently."
